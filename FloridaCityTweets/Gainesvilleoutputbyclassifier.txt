6424622	5852884376	@Gennefer Talking Heads reference, he has bought my attention for long enough to read this. ;)	2009-11-19 02:45:19				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852864874	@Gennefer I'm a user experience guy myself so I am definitely on page with you, but I'd say it was flawed prioritization not stupidity.	2009-11-19 02:43:49				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852857620	@Gennefer Certainly that's a part of it, but the reason they didn't just add a "RT" button is because this is smarter data collecting.	2009-11-19 02:43:13				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852839915	@Gennefer At least that's what my armchair reverse-engineering is screaming at me.	2009-11-19 02:41:50				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852832059	@Gennefer It's designed to collect meta / relational / trending data for business purposes, not to be user friendly.	2009-11-19 02:41:12				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852793157	@thebrassbunny I like riffing about political systems, but not about current-event politics.	2009-11-19 02:38:06				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852762763	@thebrassbunny I think hating politics should be a prerequisite for being in politics.	2009-11-19 02:35:43				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852750463	The RT button did nothing other than provide us with a fun new talking about for the next 3 days or so. Which I strongly encourage of course	2009-11-19 02:34:48				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852723947	@Gennefer You know Gennefer it is not at all my fault that new things scare you. You really should not take this out on me.	2009-11-19 02:32:45				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852705678	@thebrassbunny really sustainable. Fascism, well, that would only work if you managed to put the "perfect" leader in charge (impossible)	2009-11-19 02:31:22				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852689983	@thebrassbunny Communism only really works when there is an opt-in or overwhelming force to keep people in line. Neither of these are -	2009-11-19 02:30:17				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852666131	@Gennefer It's fun and creepy at the same time. I now have the power to introduce everyone to all the creepy people I talk to. (*winknudge*)	2009-11-19 02:28:25				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852640065	@thebrassbunny Feeling philosophical tonight Chris?	2009-11-19 02:26:20				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852625981	@Gennefer What I'm not allowed to have self-serving meta-conversations about Twitter anymore? I thought that's what this thing was for. ;)	2009-11-19 02:25:15				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852608743	@thebrassbunny Nothing wrong with nihilism per se, it's just used as a pejorative too often.	2009-11-19 02:23:58				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852562169	Twitter is a giant pool of sometimes funny, sometimes poignant information I can only drink from with a sippy straw.	2009-11-19 02:20:24				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852547810	@thebrassbunny It's the difference between Slaughter House 5 (fatalist) and Nietzsche (nihilist)	2009-11-19 02:19:16				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852530340	@thebrassbunny meaning but that meaning is immutable. Nihilists believe you can do anything because it doesn't matter anyway.	2009-11-19 02:17:51				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852524485	@thebrassbunny Cynics can seem nihilistic. It's really pretty different though, almost opposite. Fatalist believe that everything has -	2009-11-19 02:17:22				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852459869	@thebrassbunny or consequence of those things. The question would be if nothing is meaningful/important why is it driving (determining) fate	2009-11-19 02:12:15				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852450199	@thebrassbunny Yea fatalism is usually determinism. Things will happen the way they will no matter what. Nihilism negates the meaning -	2009-11-19 02:11:31				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852392599	@thebrassbunny That one might be a little harder. Nothing matters except all of those things that determine your destiny?	2009-11-19 02:06:57				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852377055	I wonder if I could append Social Media onto the end of any random comment and it would suddenly become relevant. Hm, new project.	2009-11-19 02:05:44				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852346063	Thank you to @tamar and @violetmae for giving me a reason to test out the shiny, new RT button.	2009-11-19 02:03:26				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852326046	@thebrassbunny I'm a cynical humanist, the voices in my head don't really agree that often.	2009-11-19 02:01:59				Gainesville, FL
6424622	5852267026	@thebrassbunny Yes they can, they can be frustrated or disappointed.	2009-11-19 01:57:42				Gainesville, FL
