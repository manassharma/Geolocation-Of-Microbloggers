31495004	5210705806	@galenking We were thinking the same thing. It would be a feature though, so would be behind others in implementation priority.	2009-10-27 15:55:52				Tampa, FL

31495004	5200033606	@galenking The problem is that people will use templating for the API, so they expect a value with no format. We'll think on this one.	2009-10-27 08:16:04				Tampa, FL
31495004	5192622641	@galenking An example date I just got is "Sunday 1 November 2009." Are you sure you're not using Single Line Text? Or, plain text emails?	2009-10-26 22:56:33				Tampa, FL

31495004	5178805831	@cajebo That occurs if you POST to us w/out a secure key. You have to use the Submit API, or send the key found in your API Information tab.	2009-10-26 13:05:14				Tampa, FL
31495004	5178773501	@adamoc I was wrong. The Submit API only offers JSON since it has not been converted to our new libraries. Query API offers both.	2009-10-26 13:03:47				Tampa, FL
31495004	5177662325	@adamoc The setting of 'XML' that you pass to us is case sensitive (known bug - we need to make it work for all cases). See if that works.	2009-10-26 12:13:13				Tampa, FL
31495004	5172534531	@adamoc You do need to POST that. WIll be tough to help you troubleshoot through Twitter. We can walk you through if you send us an email.	2009-10-26 08:19:22				Tampa, FL

31495004	3687329871	@galenking Short term would be setting up the payment gateway to send out receipts. We do hope to have more control of this though.	2009-09-01 07:35:21				Tampa, FL
31495004	3678432408	@galenking Notifications to yourself work that way, but when dealing with the end user we try to go the explicit route to avoid confusion.	2009-08-31 20:18:53				Tampa, FL

13322212	5695462230	@justmikesmith I've learned that the standard reality of opinions holds true in the Twitterverse. Opinions are like butts. Everyone has one.	2009-11-13 18:06:07				Tampa, FL
13322212	5693549068	@YoPzelInsWriter Probably because it's more directly participative.  That seems reasonable.	2009-11-13 16:49:44				Tampa, FL
13322212	5693267770	@justmikesmith It would seem that most religions have a self-preservation mechanism in place whereby they always get a chunk of it.	2009-11-13 16:38:30				Tampa, FL
13322212	5693253191	@justmikesmith That's just a huge question, in itself, isn't it?  Regardless of how I get $, what is the best way to use it?	2009-11-13 16:37:56				Tampa, FL
13322212	5693199410	@billfromsc Yes - in each case I'm paid for a task: drive here and "attend this conference call" - they are both "jobs", much lk mechanic	2009-11-13 16:35:45				Tampa, FL
13322212	5693178643	@LoveStats An excellent point.  Is it safe to drive with a headset?	2009-11-13 16:34:56				Tampa, FL
13322212	5692024674	A good mechanic might be billable for 24 hours of work in a single 8 hour day.  Is this deceitful - or is it just "sound business"?	2009-11-13 15:49:59				Tampa, FL
13322212	5691969057	Mechanics refer to a rate book that says how many hours a task "should" take. If it takes 1/4 that time or all of it, you get billed 4 all.	2009-11-13 15:47:43				Tampa, FL
13322212	5691877028	@billfromsc Is there a law or something?  I'm not being sarcastic - from where does this strong statement originate?	2009-11-13 15:44:06				Tampa, FL
13322212	5691781017	@justmikesmith I didn't realize there was a section in the Bible, Torah, or Koran that specified how to bill for your work.	2009-11-13 15:40:20				Tampa, FL
13322212	5691481491	Interesting: Opinions range from "no way" to "split it" to "you deserve a reward for your efficiency"	2009-11-13 15:28:57				Tampa, FL

14206607	4116263763	@Tall_Geek I either need to get you screenshots, or lend you my system for a bit or something so you can tweak as you like. #sstweet	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116276708	@Tall_Geek OK - I won't be going to bed for another 15 minutes or so.	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116311169	@Tall_Geek I've got it set to 1080p - I can see turquoise on the sides right now.	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116365559	@Tall_Geek bad pic, but it might give you an idea http://yfrog.com/6cuw3j	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116383099	@Tall_Geek width isn't a problem at all - we have a ton of space to work in there. Hope the pick helps #sstweet	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116439438	@Tall_Geek Yup. You have 1920x1080	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116465551	@Tall_Geek The white space got bigger, but the table is the same size. I'd jack the rest up to 1800 even if you want to try it.	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116498925	@MariaLaino PARTY NERD IN THE HIZ-OUSE!	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116542386	@Tall_Geek I can do that - I can jack up the text size though if we want too. Actually, we should figure 720 anyway #sstweet	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116547185	@Tall_Geek since we don't know what kind of monitor resolution they support, assuming 720p is pretty safe.	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116581809	@Tall_Geek I just tweaked the resolution setting - new pic coming soon #sstweet	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL

14206607	4116743703	@Tall_Geek Hold on - I'm switching to 720p now, and then I'll take another pic.	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116763232	@Tall_Geek this is 720p http://yfrog.com/18ed3qj	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116770406	@Tall_Geek at 720 it's pretty readable - if the table stretched to fill the white space, bigger font, would be near perfect.	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116800760	@Tall_Geek Er - don't know, my room is only 10 feet in length. At 20 might be too small to see. And almost no room on sides for ads #sstweet	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116854247	@Tall_Geek That's pretty good. I'd go with a thicker font in the end, but the size is good.	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
14206607	4116910003	@Tall_Geek Hold on - I'll take a new pic. Two shakes #sstweet	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Tampa, FL
