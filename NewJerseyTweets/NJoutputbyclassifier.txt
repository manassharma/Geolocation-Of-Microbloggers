18753280	5455336423	@newtypegirlie aw it's all good. Sports allegiances are really weird anyway. Philly teams are usually kind of rough, so I'm used to it.	2009-11-05 11:52:00				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5454069502	@newtypegirlie I'm a flyers fan. They've been kind of hit or miss this season, but the line managing has been pretty terrible. : (	2009-11-05 10:58:29				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5453978156	Phils lost and Daggett got blown out of the water. If the Eagles melt down, I'm gonna start following golf. And not the fun kind, either.	2009-11-05 10:54:47				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5451479764	@Talint It never is. But that's what you get from rivalries and being a fan away from home.	2009-11-05 09:13:29				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5442684930	@AnarCHris Not at all. Guy absolutely came alive when it mattered. Sucks for me, but he defined playoff clutch.	2009-11-04 23:31:05				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5442535977	@AnarCHris Both teams had HUGE holes in their line-ups. The main difference was that Yanks consistently had base runners for their HRs.	2009-11-04 23:22:55				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5442423879	@makeitepic We held our own against the best team in baseball having a historic season. Burnett, Jeter, Mastui and Damon were killer.	2009-11-04 23:17:03				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5442181548	@AnarCHris @Krys @makeitepic @DJRanmaS *fistbump* you guys won this top to bottom. We took it to 6 and played well. see you next year!	2009-11-04 23:05:33				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5442002867	@makeitepic @Krys I love it. And enjoy the ride and the emotion guys. Cause we're gonna re-work that bullpen! And we'll see you next season.	2009-11-04 22:58:01				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5441987268	@Krys @makeitepic I may be a phillyfag, but I'm also a baseballfag. seeing a well played, series and a real match-up between the best?	2009-11-04 22:57:21				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5441858592	Bandwagon Fans- it'll never mean as much to you as it does to anyone who really cares. stop pretending and start being real.	2009-11-04 22:52:38				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5441838463	New York fans- congrats. you guys outplayed Philly and had some very smart bullpen managing. Girardi showed some real chops.	2009-11-04 22:52:01				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5441673161	Why Matt Stairs?! Charlie has really not done the phils any favors this series at all. unfortunately it was the world series.	2009-11-04 22:45:21				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5441014745	@DJRanmaS Haha, there's quite a lot of options, really.	2009-11-04 22:14:12				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5440721198	Don't like pulling Chan Ho Park here. I don't like it at all. that was entirely on fielding.	2009-11-04 22:00:45				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5440571514	@DJRanmaS of course not. I'm saying that even a 75% Joba is better than the rest of their relievers.	2009-11-04 21:54:08				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5440371581	@DJRanmaS Joba seems a little off, but he's the man you want in. coke or gaudin is a gift to us at this point. If Philly can get 2 on...	2009-11-04 21:45:13				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5439269180	@DJRanmaS in the popular vote, bush only lost by 1%. This is much, much worse.	2009-11-04 20:59:45				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	5439249394	Seriously. I just wrote a long ass post on my Philly board about how Werth, Utley, Lee, Happ and Stairs were the only people not to blow it.	2009-11-04 20:59:02				Jersey City, NJ

18753280	6284728986	@GamePro I'm sure it goes without saying, but any tidbits about the future of Killer 7 and it's cast would be rad as hell!	2009-12-02 17:18:10				Jersey City, NJ

18753280	6281990113	@FINALLEVEL What was the best rap album to come out this year? Seems like a lot of cats fell off lately.	2009-12-02 15:41:11				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6280936633	@TheSchmendrick As long as politicians put their interests above that of the constituency, democracy will always fail.	2009-12-02 15:02:27				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6280886785	@Tex8503 It might not be something you WANTED to know, but now you are aware of the 20+ games about dudes in speedos that shoot "protein".	2009-12-02 15:00:39				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6280348965	@Tex8503 The Cho Aniki games have actually been around for a while. They're usually shooters, but it's a venerable franchise. In Japan.	2009-12-02 14:40:39				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6280310621	@TheSchmendrick It feels like every local elections is won by the room full of old white men. Good thing we don't have a "boss" anymore.	2009-12-02 14:39:14				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6280272267	@AnarCHris It would depend on which half is which. Although I do love tires and my exhaust is deadly.	2009-12-02 14:37:48				Jersey City, NJ

18753280	6276792019	@makeitepic hope they don't leave us on a crazy cliffhanger... like they surely will. Does Will find out about Terri or Finn about Quinn?	2009-12-02 12:25:05				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6276634285	@makeitepic I am way excited for Glee tonight! I rewatched last week's episode last night. SO GOOD. Sucks there's only two more til April	2009-12-02 12:19:02				Jersey City, NJ

18753280	6273816175	@TheSchmendrick We can play this friday, hopefully!	2009-12-02 10:32:30				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6272806891	And I'm probably out of whatever Christmas party is being planned. Possibly New Years as well.	2009-12-02 09:55:23				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6272689103	@AnarCHris I'm really trying in Tekken! Finally starting to payoff. and I'm in on thurs.	2009-12-02 09:51:03				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6272676431	@TheSchmendrick I actually learned how to nail that post combo throw. Feels GREAT and really lets me punish the cpu.	2009-12-02 09:50:34				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6259657129	@Omega_Zed but here, once you land that hit, it's ALL about maximizing combo damage before your opponent gets a chance to recover.	2009-12-01 22:29:01				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6259647075	@Omega_Zed It's hard to get used to though. in Tekken, it's all about that first hit. other games, it's more about stringing the combo.	2009-12-01 22:28:36				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6259498167	@Omega_Zed haha I tried! anyway, yea, I'm definitely getting on board with Tekken. when you can kick ass a lot, this game RULES!	2009-12-01 22:22:22				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6259358069	I owe @kenobi_zedsan and @theschmendrick apologies!! I am finally clicking with Tekken. King is a combo MACHINE!!!!!!!	2009-12-01 22:16:42				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6257403363	@mcslanty They're really tricky to get the hang of! but damn, you feel like a P-I-M-P when you nail one! My boy King is rough though.	2009-12-01 21:04:45				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6257162356	When I'm good at it, Tekken 6 is really, really fun.	2009-12-01 20:56:42				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6257100763	@chriscolfer Can't wait to catch it! Haven't watched Tonight Show in a few months, but gotta support the Gleeks!	2009-12-01 20:54:31				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6254795987	I like Tekken more when it's zany kangaroos and old doctors. magic russian robots just aren't as fun.	2009-12-01 19:36:44				Jersey City, NJ
18753280	6249560985	@DocEther Physically, it's a whole different argument. I guess I'm just saying general demeanor and delivery.	2009-12-01 16:41:24				Jersey City, NJ

14525172	6208022255	@nekromantikmc Same here. I've been wearing the high padding ones to the gym to lift. I had too many problems running in them.	2009-11-30 11:51:28				Collingswood, NJ

14525172	6202887574	@AmyZQuinn Philly marathon needs its own race director. That would help them get more organized to do such things.	2009-11-30 08:40:55				Collingswood, NJ

25869185	4053065059	@Connectionary I'm saying as a result of insurance "reform", care will suffer. Govt can't fix insurance or care tho. Can only make it worse	2009-09-17 07:09:00				Jersey City, NJ
25869185	4053180170	@Connectionary No, no. Doing that will only increase costs. Insurance measures risk. Increase risk, increase cost. Won't work.	2009-09-17 07:09:00				Jersey City, NJ

25869185	4053299848	@Connectionary But govt has created an environment where that kind of behavior thrives.	2009-09-17 07:09:00				Jersey City, NJ

25869185	4053394001	@Connectionary Agreed. But those licensing laws and prescription laws, etc, is a great example of govt driving up cost.	2009-09-17 08:09:00				Jersey City, NJ
25869185	4053418044	@Connectionary Paid for by who? They are subsidized heavily at the least.	2009-09-17 08:09:00				Jersey City, NJ
25869185	4053455490	@Connectionary The problem with health care is cost. That high cost is directly caused by the govt's ridiculous interventions in the market	2009-09-17 08:09:00				Jersey City, NJ
25869185	4053462652	@Connectionary The only socially responsible thing the govt can do is stay out and let a free market work its magic	2009-09-17 08:09:00				Jersey City, NJ
25869185	4053486304	@Connectionary It can only foster competition by getting out of the way. Everything govt does to fix the problems inhibit competition	2009-09-17 08:09:00				Jersey City, NJ
