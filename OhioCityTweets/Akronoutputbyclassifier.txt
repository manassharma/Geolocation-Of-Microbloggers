18993761	6385555903	I'm so popular today. My phone has been ringing off the hook! On my way out. Hooray for fun times!	2009-12-05 19:01:47				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6384838556	@ViVaLaJ87 Why didn't we get an invite?	2009-12-05 18:34:16				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6383661484	@KatyComeTrue Yeah, it'll be interesting the hear the tone of the album.	2009-12-05 17:47:53				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6383586605	@KatyComeTrue It was decent. Not as good as it could've been. Her husband died last year so she probably put a lot emotion into the new one.	2009-12-05 17:44:50				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6382980896	Corrine Bailey Rae is coming out with a new album in February. I can't wait. It's long overdue.	2009-12-05 17:20:07				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6382279251	I was having a great convo with the VP of international marketing for FOX until my phone powered off. Grrr.	2009-12-05 16:51:21				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6372529454	@JaiBrownlow Definitely a marketing strategy. But it would've been better it if was blended more into the interview. It was too obvious.	2009-12-05 10:12:07				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6372140368	@necolebitchie Wow, so the title of that post is just a tactic to reel people in to reading the post. Very well played ;)	2009-12-05 09:55:42				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6360517705	@ShanelleLaCole Yes, I saw it. She's a joke.	2009-12-04 22:32:23				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6359267240	So... that was it?	2009-12-04 21:39:52				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6359093952	Wow. Is 20/20 going to play the entire Crawl video? Nice publicity but where is the rest of the interview?	2009-12-04 21:32:53				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6359001846	I knew Rihanna lied when she said she didn't hear Chris' song. He played it for her in person. Lies!	2009-12-04 21:29:20				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6358636555	@angelonfire Right! The moment she said "I did," it was over for her. That was a confession.	2009-12-04 21:14:29				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6354705987	Dammit! I just missed a phone call from Sony Music. It must be about @mechanicaldummy. Grrr!	2009-12-04 18:39:31				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6354134286	It's a shame your day can go from good to terrible in the matter of seconds.	2009-12-04 18:17:23				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6351075626	@JaiBrownlow Yelp didn't either. That's disrespectful.	2009-12-04 16:17:52				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6350712657	Wow. Just listened to a Jay-Z interview from 1995 before he was known outside of Brooklyn. It's amazing how people change.	2009-12-04 16:03:52				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6348122215	@HEARTSofLOVE1 I'm surprised you were there for so long. My aunt had the same surgery but was OK by day 2. They do them by laser now.	2009-12-04 14:24:05				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6347783130	@yaya_330 Thanks! I feel cool, so maybe I am. :)	2009-12-04 14:11:03				Akron, Ohio

18993761	6347362396	Just read a great post about Tiger that explains what he did isn't technically cheating. Interesting perspective - http://bit.ly/8Cd1oF	2009-12-04 13:54:52				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6347174168	Just turned on Pandora & what's the first song I hear? "I Wanna Be" by @MechanicalDummy. I'm getting so excited to meet him next week. Aaah!	2009-12-04 13:47:31				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6346144630	@lzone I like the change. The old Sun-Maid girl was too Little House on the Prairie-ish.	2009-12-04 13:08:14				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6345720371	In 2010, power outlets will have USB ports. Finally!	2009-12-04 12:52:51				Akron, Ohio

18993761	6342990821	@csledzik I was thinking about coming back to get my master's degree in PR or IAKM. How are you liking the program?	2009-12-04 11:20:19				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6342874927	Next Wednesday is Kent State's PR Campaigns presentations. Will any of my Twitter friends be attending?	2009-12-04 11:16:18				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6342793941	@csledzik Lol. It's better than Vista but possesses the same functions: online courses, discussions, calendar, wiki, etc.	2009-12-04 11:13:31				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6342652924	@csledzik It's a fun project but will take a bit of time to learn. It's comparable to Kent's Vista.	2009-12-04 11:08:38				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6342031200	I'm excited for my next project: developing a virtual academy for @projectlearn. Tech time!	2009-12-04 10:46:24				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6341940166	@KapriC @MsPatriceMarie Remember when we were at Citgo & I tried to stunt & peel off but went in reverse and backed into the dumpter? Fail.	2009-12-04 10:43:14				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6340343168	Alicia Keys and Beyonce's new song isn't what I expected. It had the potential to be much better. A little catchy but it lacks hotness.	2009-12-04 09:48:02				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6338606184	@KapriC The funniest part was when you kept driving and dancing as you were hitting his car.	2009-12-04 08:46:46				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6337983242	@falishalee I have to see it ASAP! We used to record everything. Was Jaelah a Michelin man body double?	2009-12-04 08:23:27				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6337610856	@chrisbrogan Sounds like fun! I speak to my daughter's Kindergarten class next month. I have no idea how to explain my work to them.	2009-12-04 08:08:59				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6337575834	I love the new Mobile Twitter. It isn't better than TweetDeck but it stumps what it looked like before the change.	2009-12-04 08:07:34				Akron, Ohio

18993761	6324589621	I lied. I still have a headache but couldn't miss 30 Rock. Tonight's episode is hilarious! Glad I stayed up. I'll sleep in 12 minutes.	2009-12-03 20:49:17				Akron, Ohio

18993761	6323313120	Q5 Collaboration is also key. Be respectful of everyone's ideas and find common ground. #u30pro	2009-12-03 20:04:07				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6323260714	I am in LOVE with the new Gap Kids commercial. Jaelah easily could've starred in it. How cute are these boots?	2009-12-03 20:02:19				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6323215086	Q5 Communication is important. When it's lacking, the gap gets larger. Don't want that to happen? Communicate. #u30pro	2009-12-03 20:00:48				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6322623375	Q3 Just because you have the "manager" title doesn't mean you are the best at EVERYTHING. Accept this. #u30pro	2009-12-03 19:40:05				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6322429111	@DavidSpinks I like to be challenged. Introduce me to new trends. Give me a tough assignment. Struggling isn't always a bad thing. #u30pro	2009-12-03 19:33:13				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6322364805	Q2 Gen Y seems to care about opportunity and growth. If one company doesn't have it, they move on to the next.  #u30pro	2009-12-03 19:30:59				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6322202667	@CatherineEllen You're right. Many jobs want someone who is knowledgeable about current trends but has more exp than Gen Y employees #u30pro	2009-12-03 19:25:20				Akron, Ohio

18993761	6321962777	@LenKendall I'm more interested in helping colleagues rather than elevating myself - the latter won't benefit my employer or client. #u30pro	2009-12-03 19:16:57				Akron, Ohio
18993761	6321843696	RT @ryanstephens Gen Y has trouble putting their head down if their superiors dont explain the value of their contributions (Ditto!) #u30pro	2009-12-03 19:12:46				Akron, Ohio
