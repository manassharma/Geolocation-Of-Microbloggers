14221435	6239611366	@ChrisFerdinandi Agree all very important. But to make mass change you need to influence the influencers & have reach. #SHRM has that in HR.	2009-12-01 10:31:46				Cincinnati, OH

14221435	6239017598	@ChrisFerdinandi To solve "problems", you have to get involved/provide leadership. Critiquing as a spectator will always be less effective	2009-12-01 10:10:11				Cincinnati, OH
