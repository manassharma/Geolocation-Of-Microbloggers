70469539	5874327898	@Jayyjayyhearts				Irving, Texas
31149770	5749574453	So the Packers are out of challenges now.	2009-11-15 17:41:10				Irving, TX
31149770	5749518648	Looks like a touchdown to me. 10 points almost seems insurmountable, doesn't it?	2009-11-15 17:38:57				Irving, TX
31149770	5749437449	Three penalties on Orlando Scandrick today.	2009-11-15 17:35:41				Irving, TX
31149770	5749403404	Really important for the Cowboys defense to hold Green Bay to 3 here.	2009-11-15 17:34:21				Irving, TX
31149770	5749366208	It's a right ankle sprain for Hamlin.	2009-11-15 17:32:53				Irving, TX
31149770	5749355599	Hamlin just went to the locke room.	2009-11-15 17:32:29				Irving, TX
31149770	5749283667	The Packers went straight at Pat Watkins with Hamlin out.	2009-11-15 17:29:46				Irving, TX
31149770	5749263535	Tough game here. Cold. Lot of injuries. Hard hitting. Neither team getting much done offensively.	2009-11-15 17:28:57				Irving, TX
31149770	5749124764	I've been watching Doug Free pretty closely. Though Romo's been sacked quite a few times, it hasn't been because of him. He's been good.	2009-11-15 17:23:20				Irving, TX
31149770	5749022429	Just 114 total yards for the Cowboys offense today. Strange they've been grounded. Maybe it really is something about 3-4 defenses.	2009-11-15 17:19:09				Irving, TX
31149770	5748941872	Terrible drop by Roy Williams. You just have to catch that. No excuse.	2009-11-15 17:15:47				Irving, TX
31149770	5748874116	OK, Cowboys need to get something going with this drive. 80 yards just seems like a really long way to go right now, doesn't it?	2009-11-15 17:13:06				Irving, TX
31149770	5748815154	Wow, very strange celebration by Bobby Carpenter there. Coulda done without the pelvic thrust.	2009-11-15 17:10:47				Irving, TX
31149770	5748697938	Don't know how they missed Marcus Spears being held on Grant's off tackle run for 13.	2009-11-15 17:06:07				Irving, TX
31149770	5748666992	What did ya'll think of the replay call? The TVs in the press box are like the size of the one I had in my room when I was 6 years old.	2009-11-15 17:04:56				Irving, TX
31149770	5748527375	Don't know who will win the challenge here, but I don't like the refs holding the ready to play whistly until McCarthy could see the replay.	2009-11-15 16:59:37				Irving, TX
31149770	5748429126	Too many sacks today. They've got to do a better job of picking up blitzers. Romo makes the O-Line calls.	2009-11-15 16:55:36				Irving, TX
31149770	5748347289	Gotta admit I'm a little surprised to see Felix as the kick returner. Thought it might be Ogletree this week.	2009-11-15 16:52:19				Irving, TX
31149770	5747999883	That was one ugly half of football. Both teams.	2009-11-15 16:38:05				Irving, TX
31149770	5747964952	Really nice play by Bradie James to break up the screen pass. Not an easy 47 yard kick coming up.	2009-11-15 16:36:40				Irving, TX
31149770	5747886147	Just a tough half for the offense. They went away from the run, and it's hurt them. Romo's just got 94 yards, even with the Roy's 42 yarder.	2009-11-15 16:33:32				Irving, TX
31149770	5747793577	They're going to need Flozell to do better against Clay Matthews next time. Didn't even get a finger on him before he sacked Romo.	2009-11-15 16:29:56				Irving, TX
31149770	5747668872	Anybody else see Romo acting like he was going to fight Johnny Jolly?	2009-11-15 16:24:57				Irving, TX
31149770	5747642070	That's just how it's been for Roy Williams since he got here. 42 yard catch whiped out by his fumble.	2009-11-15 16:23:52				Irving, TX
31149770	5747489493	Bobby Carpenter's playing two hand touch it looks like. His whiff allowed Brandon Jackson to pick up the first down on that 3rd down screen.	2009-11-15 16:17:45				Irving, TX
31149770	5747371956	Packers' Daryn Colledge has an ankle injury, his return is questionable.	2009-11-15 16:13:00				Irving, TX
31149770	5747240067	I'm told Pam Oliver is reporting high ankle sprain... it was announced in the press box as a broken fibula. Cowboys PR says it's a break.	2009-11-15 16:07:43				Irving, TX
31149770	5747199185	Victor Butler has alternated in... Earlier than we're used to see him.	2009-11-15 16:06:02				Irving, TX
31149770	5747126754	Probably a stinger. He was too confident on his feet for it to be anything concussion-like.	2009-11-15 16:03:06				Irving, TX
31149770	5747108112	Looks like a concussion or a stinger for Bradie James, but he's popped up and jogging off on his own. May be able to return.	2009-11-15 16:02:20				Irving, TX
31149770	5746988710	Bad break for Marc Colombo. Broken fibula, and possibly lost for the season.	2009-11-15 15:57:41				Irving, TX
31149770	5746851264	Wow... After a replay I really thought he caught it. We're dealing with some small TVs up here. Need one hanging over the field.	2009-11-15 15:51:59				Irving, TX
31149770	5746798947	Bad challenge... Should have waited to see more replays since the quarter is ending. Wade's guys upstairs did him a disservice.	2009-11-15 15:49:51				Irving, TX
31149770	5746736483	They've found something in GB to have success bringing guys off the slot. Nate Jones in '07 hurt Favre, and Henry had 2 sacks last yr.	2009-11-15 15:47:10				Irving, TX
31149770	5746703127	Really thought the Cowboys would have some success with slot blitzes today... On the road show Scandrick was defensive when asked about it.	2009-11-15 15:45:46				Irving, TX
31149770	5746562137	Looks like either Miles or Witten made a mistake on the third down play. Poor pooch punt by Mat McBriar. Gotta do better than the 17.	2009-11-15 15:39:51				Irving, TX
31149770	5746463061	Colombo going to the cart, and straight to the locker room.	2009-11-15 15:35:38				Irving, TX
31149770	5746449603	And with Colombo down, we may be seeing more of Free. Not good if this is a serious injury. Colombo's a big part of that line.	2009-11-15 15:35:05				Irving, TX
31149770	5746420156	Barber's first down run was with an unbalanced line... Doug Free was in the game lined up as an eligible tight end.	2009-11-15 15:33:52				Irving, TX
31149770	5746354257	So a pair of missed field goals at the start here. Green Bay's hurts worse because the Cowboys will take over on the Packers' 42 yard line.	2009-11-15 15:31:09				Irving, TX
