17768559	4128920988	@pookasluagh Oh, no, only review copies have 2 be 6 mos or older. Regular books that you've bought can be from anytime, a yr ago or wk ago!	2009-09-20 13:09:00				Arlington, VA
17768559	4129322430	@DevourerofBooks Yeah, I honestly don't know if I can do it, but I have SO MANY books on my shelves...it seems a bit ambitious	2009-09-20 14:09:00				Arlington, VA

8336462	4058110986	@t_de_baillon Another great clue. Thanks.	2009-09-17 12:09:00				Arlington, TX
8336462	4058172140	@t_de_baillon : ) That's what makes them 'personal'. As I like to say, there is no irrational behavior. It is we who lack the 'rationale'.	2009-09-17 12:09:00				Arlington, TX
8336462	4058182834	@t_de_baillon Yes, I was noting that in the Wikipedia entry. Putting it on my list to find at the University library.	2009-09-17 12:09:00				Arlington, TX

8336462	4058235498	@t_de_baillon Where I disagree with Mauss (unless the interpretations are off) is in the 'obligation'. I see it as an 'equity'.	2009-09-17 12:09:00				Arlington, TX

8336462	4058618246	@t_de_baillon Another analogy closer to 'keeping up w/Jones' (expressing one's wealth) are rites of passage social events: Weddings, etc.	2009-09-17 12:09:00				Arlington, TX
