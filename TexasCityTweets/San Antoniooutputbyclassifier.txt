779141	6130536002	Just finished a media interview about "non-traditional marketing".  Was fun, and think I did fine.  Time will tell :)	2009-11-27 20:44:16				San Antonio, TX

779141	6129516635	@lenire Yep - owned by a Danish company and the beer sounds German.  Also comes from a region that has changed nationalities often.  :)	2009-11-27 20:01:33				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129430482	@chrstphrbrwn I did not overlook - stated I have been there.  Beer was excellent.  Not enough to please me. :)  We part in peace ;)	2009-11-27 19:58:07				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129405198	@dshafik Close - yes.  The same? Considering how the French are protective of "Champagne"  I think close isn't close enough :)	2009-11-27 19:57:01				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129378335	@timylee Hard to tell - the name sounds German. It's a decent beer, no doubt.  But I doubt anyone thinks of it as a "French Beer".	2009-11-27 19:55:53				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129261820	And my last tweet applies to almost anything - from hosting to groceries. :)	2009-11-27 19:50:59				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129243286	@chrstphrbrwn There are a LOT of places to get a great beer.  There are fewer GREAT places to enjoy a great beer.  You need both :)	2009-11-27 19:50:12				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129086712	So I guess my statement still stands - the French can't make good beer (and look at my name - I AM French!).	2009-11-27 19:43:34				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129064534	@chrstphrbrwn Ah - but still not officially part of France, even if the majority speak the language.	2009-11-27 19:42:37				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129019365	@chrstphrbrwn :) Good.  Tell them to visit Lion and Rose or Saucer - comfortable chairs make me stay/spend!	2009-11-27 19:40:42				San Antonio, TX
779141	6129002006	@timylee Owened by Carlsberg - a Danish company.  Not sure it qualifies as a "French beer" now.	2009-11-27 19:40:00				San Antonio, TX
779141	6128963631	@chrstphrbrwn I don't count Belgium as French (at all) - not sure I am familiar with Walloon (sounds Australian!)	2009-11-27 19:38:20				San Antonio, TX
779141	6128896738	@chrstphrbrwn They need some leather sofas and they can get me back.  Steel chairs just don;t work for me - especially when it gets chilly.	2009-11-27 19:35:27				San Antonio, TX
779141	6128783416	Just had a thought.  Is there such a thing as a great French beer?  Racking my brain, but can;t think of one.	2009-11-27 19:30:38				San Antonio, TX
779141	6128673272	@saintX Agreed.  How can I be held responsible for my decisions?!  (and please - give me "free" heath care and pay my mortgage) *gads*	2009-11-27 19:26:04				San Antonio, TX
779141	6128340168	@chrstphrbrwn Been there.  Find the furniture very uncomfortable for my old ass to spend much time on.  Need the padding I don't provide :)	2009-11-27 19:12:01				San Antonio, TX
779141	6128259986	@kellern I'll drink almost anything Belgian - THEY know their beer!	2009-11-27 19:08:40				San Antonio, TX
779141	6128116264	@RackerHacker Yeah - a bit sweet for me.  But again - a good beer (for a wheat beer) :)	2009-11-27 19:02:36				San Antonio, TX
