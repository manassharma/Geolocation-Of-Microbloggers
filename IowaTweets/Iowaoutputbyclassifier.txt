6750322	5679165913	@sbergus I want better catagories, the ability to refine seaches and other ways to sort. Also, I want to be able to search using a computer.	2009-11-13 07:23:33				Iowa City, Iowa
6750322	5670545219	But the Android Market needs an iTunes, something that makes it easier to find and search for apps.	2009-11-12 22:09:39				Iowa City, Iowa
6750322	5670425259	If I had a cool idea for an app and the right coding skills, I'd build it for Android instead being just another iPhone app.	2009-11-12 22:04:14				Iowa City, Iowa
6750322	5639855166	@ryansholin Glad to see you give the Iowa doctor some cred. @AdamBSullivan does a nice job with the @drdaily.	2009-11-11 21:52:24				Iowa City, Iowa
6750322	5639592977	Downloaded the Last.fm app onto my Verizon Droid. Fired it up. At the top is an ad for AT&T touting "the nation's fastest 3G network*".	2009-11-11 21:41:10				Iowa City, Iowa
6750322	5639286338	@davewiner I find it helpful because it breaks lines into one-screen lengths, but it breaks basic rule of "don't break stuff." Also ugly.	2009-11-11 21:28:15				Iowa City, Iowa
6750322	5639063932	@davewiner Don't know that this is a bug (http://bit.ly/jtfcF). I think Droid's browser forces text into a column that fits in medium-zoom.	2009-11-11 21:18:54				Iowa City, Iowa

6750322	5504525500	@josephwagner I believe Android can also pull in your Facebook contacts, for better or worse.	2009-11-07 05:49:19				Iowa City, Iowa

42305839	4136455968	@ZachZaidman and THAT'S the difference between Cutler & either Orton or Grossman. Pretty sure Griese led that drive you mentioned.	2009-09-20 20:09:00				Iowa City, Iowa
