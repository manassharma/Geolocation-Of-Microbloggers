18177430	5610832211	She probably wants me to hand her something 2 in in front of her again. Ultimate in laziness.	2009-11-10 23:02:09				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610822948	Dog is either snoring or growling on floor. I think growling. At what is question since other dog on bed, not floor.	2009-11-10 23:01:42				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610809445	All the laughing I did over dog's farting woke me up. Gotta get sleepy again.	2009-11-10 23:01:02				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610797557	Time to wash face. Think I might try to watch 1 of the 2 Bones episodes I have left before I'm caught up. That or movie.	2009-11-10 23:00:27				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610778474	I want to invent a waterer for dogs & cats that's hooked up to water line like your fridge, but is self cleaning. Make my life easier.	2009-11-10 22:59:32				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610761734	Now I have to refill the waterer yet again or the other dog won't have anything to drink in the middle of the night. Too small for toilet.	2009-11-10 22:58:37				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610751524	My dog has drunk so much water in the last 30 minutes she's going to spout a blowhole at any minute or float away.	2009-11-10 22:58:04				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610646840	Note to self: never let the dog have a bite of your baked sweet potato ever again.	2009-11-10 22:52:32				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610634717	At least she risked the rain to spare me the odor. Still the sound...I wish I had a video camera or tape recorder set to go.	2009-11-10 22:51:55				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5610613873	Just laughed like a mad woman outside bc I could hear my dog farting clear across yard. Like a very gassy machine gun.	2009-11-10 22:50:50				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5609797111	Ah, heck. Missed the beginning of Chelsea again, & I can't find the remote.	2009-11-10 22:10:09				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5609766796	@StacieinAtlanta It made taking the trash can around front in the middle of it all today so much fun.	2009-11-10 22:08:42				Atlanta, Georgia

18177430	5609729494	@soapsindepthabc I said today that the kid just needs to go ahead & start shopping for those cement shoes. It's only a matter of time.	2009-11-10 22:06:55				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5609556284	I just hope he found shelter of some sort if didn't find his way home. If I see him tomorrow, I will call pound. At least then he'll be dry.	2009-11-10 21:59:04				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5609543867	I wanted to go scoop the scroungy thing up in a blanket, but you never know if going to bite or has parvo or rabies.	2009-11-10 21:58:28				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5609519971	He had collar so I guess he wasn't stray. It's coming down so hard now. If he didn't go home, I feel bad for not calling pound.	2009-11-10 21:57:19				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5609507904	Worried about dog I saw wondering neighborhood at lunch. He was so wet & cold in rain. Hope his owners realized he was out.	2009-11-10 21:56:43				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5602545365	I think my electric blanket has finally gone to the great blanket graveyard in the sky. Anyone know where I can get new Q one super cheap?	2009-11-10 17:12:04				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5600293261	Attention all family members. I'm not a mind reader. Glad for it, too. I don't want to know what goes on in your mind all day.	2009-11-10 15:45:17				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5600272031	Just like my sister every Christmas morn. Pouts bc she didn't get something that she failed to tell anyone she wanted.	2009-11-10 15:44:27				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5600260136	He'll find something wrong. He always does. Gets it from his mother (my sister). Probably be something he forgot to tell me he wanted on it.	2009-11-10 15:44:00				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5600249243	Going to take something for my headache & then power nap. After that-designing header for nephew, the 9 year old super critic.	2009-11-10 15:43:33				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5600216619	I guess you could say I like the non-dairy ice cream I bought. I ate way too much of it. Be nice if it was non-caloric as well.	2009-11-10 15:42:16				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5596339001	Time to fix lunch. What I don't know, but something. Don't want to take Tylenol on a semi-empty stomach.	2009-11-10 13:03:44				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5596305889	Hopefully, all the lactose intolerant people around here didn't buy them out. Have to drive a bit to get there. Nearby Publix closed down.	2009-11-10 13:02:21				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5596279921	I was going to go today, but I got soaked even with an umbrella taking back expired food to Kroger. Love the wind.	2009-11-10 13:01:18				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5596265940	Hope it's not flooding tomorrow. Last day that Publix has Purely Decadent ice cream I bought yesterday at full price at Kroger half off.	2009-11-10 13:00:44				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5596138020	@freefotofix You're welcome.	2009-11-10 12:55:22				Atlanta, Georgia

18177430	5596061997	Rain is doing a number on my sinuses. If they ever have sinus transplants in future, I'm going to be first in line.	2009-11-10 12:52:06				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5596025718	Now watch them not even go back there. They will when there's a chance they could poke eyes out. Now that path's clear...	2009-11-10 12:50:32				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5596007230	My dogs better love me. Got out in pouring rain to trim back bushes from house so they wouldn't get wet peeing.	2009-11-10 12:49:45				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5577317146	Bought a box of dog biscuits there once a year past date. Aren't people supposed to check that kind of thing?	2009-11-09 20:27:47				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5577306319	Get to go back to Kroger tomorrow & take back the faux cream cheese. It's 3 weeks past the exp. date.	2009-11-09 20:27:21				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5577233780	I know they're doing the decade thing w/ #DWTS, but still some of the song choices aren't what I'd go with for the samba.	2009-11-09 20:24:32				Atlanta, Georgia
18177430	5571623879	Off to finish the dishes I didn't finish yesterday. It's becoming the story of my life.	2009-11-09 16:51:31				Atlanta, Georgia
