1260231	3705907971	Powered down the Air, turned it back on, and voila I have Snow Leopard.  Guess the installer hung for no good reason.	2009-09-02 00:34:15				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3705862584	Hours later, Macbook Air STILL restarting after Snow Leopard installation.  I'm putting my foot down.	2009-09-02 00:30:41				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3704294311	@rebelalfons If it takes too long, the OS things something is wrong and terminates it.  Removing files can be very slow unfortunately.	2009-09-01 22:44:32				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3701282644	@mikeerickson Yes, thank you, it is being worked on.  It's a server issue and won't require an update.	2009-09-01 20:05:53				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3701207410	@hXcpat Macbook Air has no ethernet port and I don't have usb adapter.	2009-09-01 20:02:06				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3701146868	And just like that, install finished. Now it's restarting, which is also taking forever.  I am just going to leave the house and come back.	2009-09-01 19:59:10				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3700962894	I'm installing via Remote Disc over WiFi, so I'm just going to let it sit there if I have to wait 24 hours.  Next time I'm using a USB image	2009-09-01 19:49:44				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3700822413	Snow Leopard install has been stuck on "About 11 minutes" for over an hour.  Should I worry?	2009-09-01 19:42:32				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3699389724	@shawnshekari If you've already used 3.0, you're fine.  The crash only occurred if you were updating from 2.x to 3.0	2009-09-01 18:24:03				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3699343393	Thank goodness for Apple's crash log reporter.  3.02 is going to be a lot more stable.	2009-09-01 18:21:33				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3699055310	Force quitting an app while a directory is being removed must corrupt the file system.	2009-09-01 18:06:17				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3699051097	Found the reason why the FB app bricks some iPhones.  The app clears your cache on startup, and the OS nukes the app if it takes too long.	2009-09-01 18:06:04				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3698267118	@Marc_Jay Mine just started with "About 43 minutes" but it took over 30 minutes just to boot up.	2009-09-01 17:24:38				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3698157505	Wow, installing Snow Leopard on Macbook Air with Remote Disc over WiFi is sloooooooooooooooow.	2009-09-01 17:18:43				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3697351506	@Jeffrey903 I'm installing it on my lesser-used Macbook Air first to be safe.  I just want Xcode for SL with its integrated Clang.	2009-09-01 16:33:27				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3696787994	@InderdeepGill Event walls are coming in a future update.	2009-09-01 16:02:55				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3696762871	Got Snow Leopard from Amazon today, 4 days after the Apple Store would have delivered it.  I sure hope @gruber enjoys his referral fee.	2009-09-01 16:01:38				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3684534492	@hlogapp who says you can't open source your apps?	2009-09-01 03:04:49				Santa Cruz, CA

1260231	3673095091	@mertin When sending a message?  That usually means your friend went offline. I need to make that more apparent in the error.	2009-08-31 15:36:03				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3672931414	@elliotfleming Yes I am planning to do that in 3.1	2009-08-31 15:26:28				Santa Cruz, CA

1260231	3672808002	@amsoell I'd love to add groups, but I'm limited to what our API can do, and we don't have an API for groups beyond basic info.	2009-08-31 15:19:04				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3672420219	Frustrating to read negative App Store reviews without  information that could help me fix.  Dying for crash logs to show on iTunes Connect.	2009-08-31 14:57:12				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	3671579389	@KhyleDeen Yes, I'm working on it.  Not acceptable to not support accessibility, and I'm sorry I overlooked it in the first place.	2009-08-31 14:11:20				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5910063900	Flirting with the idea of getting an espresso machine. @coffeegeek is such a great site for learning about the art.	2009-11-20 21:54:51				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5907177503	jqtouch really illustrates what a fine job Apple has done improving mobile webkit/safari. So much more power than when I did iui.	2009-11-20 19:46:35				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5906794560	jQuery for iPhone (@jqtouch) is an amazing example of what's possible with iPhone web apps.  Try their demo on an iPhone.	2009-11-20 19:30:01				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5904581227	I'm personally glad the QuadCamera guy didn't sit on his hands and wait until Apple improved the public camera API.	2009-11-20 17:57:55				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5904541886	QuadCamera: another amazing app that wouldn't have existed without breaking the rules.	2009-11-20 17:56:14				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5904511269	We've all seen apps use private APIs to advance the state of the art and convince Apple to make them public.  Was augmented reality evil?	2009-11-20 17:54:57				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5904473178	@flpatriot I agree that private methods are hugely risky, and usually not worth taking, I just hate pretending Apple won't break you anyway.	2009-11-20 17:53:21				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5904192756	@flpatriot Thanks for stating the obvious. Bottom line: Apple will break your app with OS 4.0 even if you only use public APIs, so be ready.	2009-11-20 17:41:52				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5903997757	@gruber ok, they don't break binary compatibility, but they change the way APIs work and break your features, which to me is no different.	2009-11-20 17:33:53				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5903955214	@gruber Let's be real: there's not one "future-proof" binary in the app store today.  Apple breaks compatibility with every major OS update.	2009-11-20 17:32:09				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5885848841	@stroughtonsmith definitely, though I'd prefer to see the web win out so I don't have to.	2009-11-20 04:39:14				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5884788014	@byron_m I love it.  Scrolling on that smooth surface feels amazing.	2009-11-20 03:18:30				Santa Cruz, CA

1260231	5883586722	Odd that Magic Mouse momentum scrolling works in every app I've tried except Tweetie.	2009-11-20 01:49:33				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5883404070	Magic Mouse felt awkward in the store, but I took the leap and after using it for an hour at home it feels great.	2009-11-20 01:36:17				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5880478397	@console Not that I am aware of.	2009-11-19 22:43:50				Santa Cruz, CA

1260231	5876978176	@cleatsupkeep Also I'm not a huge fan of the console not being its own tab.	2009-11-19 20:17:25				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5876964570	@cleatsupkeep I want console.log to format referenced objects nicely instead of just stringifying or putting "> Object"	2009-11-19 20:16:53				Santa Cruz, CA

1260231	5876414833	Web Inspector has outdone Firebug in many ways, but its console still sucks.  Sad since that was the original point of Firebug.	2009-11-19 19:55:56				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5867466991	@halogoggles Exactly - that's why I was hoping Chrome OS would be optimized for devices that fit in your pocket.	2009-11-19 14:15:45				Santa Cruz, CA
1260231	5867190992	Kind of bummed that Chrome OS is designed for mouse+keyboard and not touch screen.	2009-11-19 14:04:52				Santa Cruz, CA
