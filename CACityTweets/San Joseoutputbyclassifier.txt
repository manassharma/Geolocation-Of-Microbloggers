14402027	5373671710	Downloaded and testing out some apps: Pandora, LinkedIn, RoboDefense, Listen.	2009-11-02 15:40:06				San Jose, CA
14402027	5372229605	How quickly I forget: Verizon's service in my office is really crappy, making it difficult to download apps, surf the Web, sync Outlook...	2009-11-02 14:37:42				San Jose, CA
14402027	5372053985	Phone seems to run REALLY hot. But that could be the ongoing sync process with Outlook, which seems to be taking a good while.	2009-11-02 14:29:53				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371909052	In the gallery, no "swiping" allowed. You have to use on-screen arrow buttons to move to next picture.	2009-11-02 14:23:19				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371892293	As far as I can tell, there's no easy way to get into your gallery from the camera. You only get to see your last picture (or video) taken.	2009-11-02 14:22:33				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371864131	Camera is SLOW. Takes a good second or two each to focus, prepare flash, and save. Don't expect to take anything close to rapid fire shots.	2009-11-02 14:21:16				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371792889	The latter will turn Droid into a super alarm clock, with big, dim-able clock numbers -- while charging it.	2009-11-02 14:18:05				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371777470	Verizon/Motorola are offering two accessories for Droid, both for $30: a car dock and a "multimedia" dock.	2009-11-02 14:17:22				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371736644	Unlike on iPhone, when Droid powers down, you can't just push the home button. You have to push the tiny (and poorly located) on/off button.	2009-11-02 14:15:33				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371679444	Verizon PR rep said there are now has 12,000 apps in the Android market.	2009-11-02 14:12:56				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371622062	Phone has a dedicated camera button on the side that opens up the camera program.	2009-11-02 14:10:19				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371564949	As far as I can tell, there's still no easy way to close programs. To switch between them, you hold down the home key to see what's running	2009-11-02 14:07:43				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371521387	Unlike on myTouch and G1, built in search feature is not just Web search; instead it will search the device also for programs, contacts.	2009-11-02 14:05:47				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371501607	In web browser, you can double tap to zoom in or out. But still no pinching.	2009-11-02 14:04:54				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371475075	Camera has built-in flash, like Pre's. Droid has easy upload of pictures to Facebook and videos to YouTube.	2009-11-02 14:03:41				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371416955	Camera is 5Mpxl and shoots video.	2009-11-02 14:01:04				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371410203	As you get to each letter in a list, that letter pops up. Much better than iPhone, where you have to click on miniscule letters.	2009-11-02 14:00:46				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371381673	Another cool thing: when scrolling through a long list, you don't have to keep "flicking." Instead, you get a virtual slider.	2009-11-02 13:59:33				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371363034	One cool feature. Like the Pre and the Cliq, Droid has an integrated address book that combines data from Facebook and Exchange server	2009-11-02 13:58:41				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371310131	Phone -- by default -- annoyingly says "Droid" in a robotic voice as an alert message. I figured out how to turn that off. Whew!	2009-11-02 13:56:13				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371286704	And buttons appear to be resistive touch buttons -- not "real," analog ones. As such, can be hard to tell if/when you've pressed them.	2009-11-02 13:55:09				San Jose, CA
14402027	5371264499	Droid has four dedicated buttons on its face: back, menu, home and search. Unlike G1 and myTouch, there's no roller ball to navigate lists.	2009-11-02 13:54:08				San Jose, CA

17984746	4138257809	@seanakita I interpret Christmas/winter holidays as a time to reflect on the year, as well as spend time w/those close to you.	2009-09-20 21:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4138267737	@seanakita I hear you on associating holidays w/work, though. Like how Memorial Day and July 4 are always busy convention times for me.	2009-09-20 21:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4138279771	Fighting the war against ants again. I'm armed with ant bait and some kind of orange spray. We'll see if it works.	2009-09-20 21:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4138292031	@seanakita Hang in there. Totally wish we could see each other more often, but know that you've got good friends on the mainland :)	2009-09-20 21:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4138692879	@seanakita Hmm about a new life, I was def. there earlier this year. When you're in one place you tend to get stuck in a rut.	2009-09-20 22:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4138714654	@seanakita I think what you probably need is a 10-day vacation. Consider dragging @jonjmurakami out to WonderCon next April!!!	2009-09-20 22:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4138740683	@jonjmurakami SDCC/cons can be stressful but I've learned it's all about attitude. Focus on having fun and REFUSE to buy "con exclusives."	2009-09-20 22:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4139686151	@ZakuMent I just went to OSH and got this stuff called Orange Guard. Not sure if it works, trying the ant bait first.	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4139698504	@jonjmurakami As for con prep, I'd have to say that when you've been doing it for over 5 years, you just kind of get used to it :)	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4139714569	Think I've mentioned it before, but I think the secret to artists' merchandise is to just make/produce what you believe in.	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4139728344	I started designing t-shirts w/my art b/c I wanted to wear them. I produced plush because I wanted to fully realize a dream.	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4139743636	I don't think an artist should produce any merchandise s/he doesn't believe in. There's no integrity in that.	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4139756878	As artists, we are emotionally tied to our works, and it carries on to the merchandise we produce.	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4139763599	Believing in your own merch is just a piece of the puzzle, but I think it is a pretty important one.	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA
17984746	4139805098	@kyubikitsy With plush, yeah, which is why I'm not doing another plush project until I clear out more of the current inventory ^_^;	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA

17984746	4139837552	@seanakita I think taking your own holiday is necessary, especially in bad economic times. Tavel can help keep a fresh perspective.	2009-09-20 23:09:00				San Jose, CA
