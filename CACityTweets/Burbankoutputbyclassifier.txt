20097100	5630422623	I find it interesting that Dollhouse can trend on Twitter yet can't get huge ratings. Also agree "Epitaph One" was one of the series' best.	2009-11-11 15:51:18				Burbank, CA
20097100	5630117251	@CK61938 I never caught that before!	2009-11-11 15:39:19				Burbank, CA
20097100	5629886818	@little_fink Yeah, but I also kind of remember him being broke a lot. Selling his place would've taken care of that...	2009-11-11 15:30:17				Burbank, CA
20097100	5629784850	@little_fink Yeah, his trailer was in Malibu, right on the ocean at the beach. Trailer was just ok but still, prime real estate.	2009-11-11 15:26:18				Burbank, CA

20097100	5628190537	@irondog1 I don't think that would be it, because "Society" is scheduled for a Friday, you'd think the night thing would leak with that news	2009-11-11 14:18:53				Burbank, CA
