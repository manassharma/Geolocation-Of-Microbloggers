26931835	4715002630	Blakeslee on #cawater: We're going to fight very hard for a deal that gets real water to real people.	2009-10-08 14:35:06				Sacramento, California
26931835	4714785890	Steinberg on #cawater: The way this is crafted it doesn't lean toward surface or ground water storage, it allows all to compete fairly.	2009-10-08 14:25:02				Sacramento, California
26931835	4714761650	Steinberg on #cawater: On the one hand we need to make sure the size of the bond is reasonable. On the other we need to get it support.	2009-10-08 14:23:51				Sacramento, California
26931835	4714745111	Steinberg on #cawater: We're going to continue to talk today about the finance piece, conservation and ground water.	2009-10-08 14:23:04				Sacramento, California
26931835	4714705350	Steinberg on #cawater: We're getting closer. I feel hopeful. There are still some outstanding issues.	2009-10-08 14:21:13				Sacramento, California

26931835	4692805217	Sen. Cogdill: Our goal is that the language allows for the construction of new surface water facilities. That is an absolute must.	2009-10-07 16:45:13				Sacramento, California

26931835	4692765964	Sen. Hollingsworth: We need to make sure the size of the bond is adequate so we can fund infrastructure.	2009-10-07 16:43:23				Sacramento, California
26931835	4692742442	Asm. Blakeslee: We've reviewed spending options and what the state can afford. There's still a possibility we can get to an agreement by Fri	2009-10-07 16:42:17				Sacramento, California
26931835	4692646169	Steinberg: I'm confident the Gov will weigh the bills on their merit, and sign the bills he deems worthy and veto those he does not.	2009-10-07 16:37:48				Sacramento, California
26931835	4692610388	Steinberg: $12 billion is just to large because of the fiscal situation we find ourselves in, and the budget cuts we've made in past years.	2009-10-07 16:36:06				Sacramento, California
26931835	4692581483	Steinberg: We're talking about the size of the bond, and the general fund obligation. But, we must invest resources in infrastructure.	2009-10-07 16:34:47				Sacramento, California
26931835	4692558879	Steinberg After Water Big 5: We had substantive conversation on financing water, and conservation.	2009-10-07 16:33:45				Sacramento, California

26931835	4663203927	Speaker Bass on Big 5: I'm hopeful that we can reach a deal by Friday. For the Governor to do a mass veto of bills would be inappropriate.	2009-10-06 14:56:35				Sacramento, California
26931835	4663089181	Steinberg on bill signing: The Governor has a constitutional duty to act on bills. I hope he'll consider them on their merits.	2009-10-06 14:50:15				Sacramento, California
