85215038	5866058073	@Parisyte I've tried it a few times here in the office. As long as there is no vibration/motion or disturbance it went into sleep	2009-11-19 13:20:42				Santa Monica, CA
85215038	5865468625	@Parisyte ironically enough we've had reports of cats running by keeping the controller on	2009-11-19 12:57:54				Santa Monica, CA
85215038	5865458003	@Parisyte It should sleep within 15 mins. Make sure there is no motion at that time or disconnect the dongle.	2009-11-19 12:57:28				Santa Monica, CA
85215038	5864788886	@Parisyte it should be negligible and  the same as the wireless remotes functionality.	2009-11-19 12:31:15				Santa Monica, CA

85215038	5864185805	@KenJeanis Could be a network hiccup not transferring data properly or dust, finger prints, scratches on the disk.	2009-11-19 12:07:35				Santa Monica, CA
85215038	5864169567	@KenJeanis Hi Ken, I'm looking into it but usually errors like that are due to a bad data read of some sort.	2009-11-19 12:06:56				Santa Monica, CA
85215038	5843307593	@Acedog_AG It's happened to other companies and other games besides ours. The game is more intensive and may expose issues with the console	2009-11-18 18:54:13				Santa Monica, CA
85215038	5843280693	@Acedog_AG It's a fairly common association with the new hot games. When these issues occur many users will automatically associate it	2009-11-18 18:53:10				Santa Monica, CA
85215038	5842630989	@Acedog_AG There's nothing in the code that can affect hardware failure. If it was a game code issue all PS3's would fail across the board	2009-11-18 18:29:24				Santa Monica, CA

85215038	5803781276	Li'l bit of clarity regarding @ATVI_Amber's mention of 1.05 - was a reply not a typo. That said, no word of a new patch has come to support.	2009-11-17 13:22:23				Santa Monica, CA
85215038	5803089772	@rainblood @ATVI_Amber's reference to 1.05 was a typo. Sorry.	2009-11-17 12:53:00				Santa Monica, CA
