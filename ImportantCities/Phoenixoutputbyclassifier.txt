22235218	5614209882	Sounds like a plan! I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Alrighty then, I'm off!	2009-11-11 02:49:15				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5614199105	But I need the batteries to get to the Alley... so I should probably get those first...	2009-11-11 02:48:21				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5614190834	...I also need batteries... but those are the opposite way of the Alley... hmmm... blast, choices...	2009-11-11 02:47:42				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5614179088	Well, I'm off to wander the Predator's Alley. I need some new scissors, and what better place to find them? But, I may, of course, return.	2009-11-11 02:46:44				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5614157881	Of course, #20 is some random mass follow-er/ing whom I've never so much as heard of, but thats okay!	2009-11-11 02:45:07				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5614139817	AHA! Would you look at that? The Gods have answered my pleadings! About time, too. I was getting sick of their bitter vindictiveness.	2009-11-11 02:43:44				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611392586	I must go and mull over this terrible fact...	2009-11-10 23:33:05				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611374029	Twenty is a WAY better number... it ends in a zero! And is therefore a multiple of five. (yeah, I passed math) but no, I have 19 followers!	2009-11-10 23:32:02				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611347035	I need another Twitter-Follower... right now I have 19. NINETEEN! Thats a terrible number. So close to a multiple of five, yet so far...	2009-11-10 23:30:32				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611300242	in fact, it would probably just make it sting something FIERCE...	2009-11-10 23:27:54				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611290747	I don't think the sarcasm would really mitigate that in any way, though...	2009-11-10 23:27:20				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611275897	well, at least the "head cleaved from your shoulders" part.	2009-11-10 23:26:30				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611268307	...sounds painful, really.	2009-11-10 23:26:04				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611263903	What would it be like to have your head cleaved from your shoulders with sarcasm...?	2009-11-10 23:25:50				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611239173	...and mine happens to be a Scottish claymore.	2009-11-10 23:24:28				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611229060	Sarcasm is the blade of the witty...	2009-11-10 23:23:56				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611202707	...hey wait, it IS Tuesday! What a coincedence!	2009-11-10 23:22:27				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611196173	...but only on Tuesdays.	2009-11-10 23:22:06				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611192122	SANITY IS FOR THE WEAK!!!	2009-11-10 23:21:53				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611185299	...and slowly driving you closer to the great jagged plateau we call madness!	2009-11-10 23:21:30				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611156311	I could, in fact, IF I SO CHOOSE, be tweeting all night! Filling up your tweet-list-thing with the glory of Raymondism...	2009-11-10 23:19:56				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611138131	Ha, no school tomorrow! Which means I won't be sleeping tonight. No need to, after all. Nothing to do tomorrow that I need to be awake for.	2009-11-10 23:18:51				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611118571	Priority of Values, thats what its all about!	2009-11-10 23:17:44				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611112373	But most of them are shorter than me, so thats okay.	2009-11-10 23:17:22				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611087901	...well, not to the ones who don't speak English, I suppose.	2009-11-10 23:15:59				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611073578	...that should be obvious.	2009-11-10 23:15:11				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611069419	And yes, I care deeply about each of my followers!	2009-11-10 23:14:59				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611062715	Though most of them speak funny languages I don't understand. Luckily, it only matters what I say. They can babble about whatever, really.	2009-11-10 23:14:35				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5611019377	But anywho, oh mysterious voice(s), yes, Algeria is definitely and obviously mine, and a fine batch of Raymondite Converts, too!	2009-11-10 23:12:09				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610999589	Hmmm, usually mist voices have more... celestial things to discuss.	2009-11-10 23:11:05				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610994752	I hear voices from the mist, calling to me, asking me... about Algeria, of all things.	2009-11-10 23:10:49				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610942475	...which is quite marvelous, I assure you.	2009-11-10 23:07:57				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610932334	I, on the other hand, intend to put them to good use! For example, as objects in my new juggling routine!	2009-11-10 23:07:23				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610906087	A terribly sinister and uncouth thing to do, you say? Well perhaps, but they certainly weren't using them, silly french folks that they are.	2009-11-10 23:06:00				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610860201	Thats right! I took entire YEARS of the history of the French nation and claimed them as my own!	2009-11-10 23:03:37				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610842991	Ha, I guess its a good thing I took all those years of french...	2009-11-10 23:02:42				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610831618	What am I doin' here?! The glory of gâteau de fromage awaits!	2009-11-10 23:02:07				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610779866	*sigh* no cupcakes... but wait! I DO have cheesecake... sweet delicious cheesecake, which is in fact BETTER than cupcakes!	2009-11-10 22:59:37				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610755414	Boredom, and an overwhelming lack of cupcakes, has once again driven me to mutter incoherently on the mighty engine we call Twitter.	2009-11-10 22:58:17				Phoenix, AZ
22235218	5610722172	Greetings, Disciples of Raymondism! ...and various other people.	2009-11-10 22:56:28				Phoenix, AZ

28112807	4147024136	@DaveMinella I saw it a couple weeks ago, thought it was terrible. Didn't find it entertaining, way too over the top, lame, etc.	2009-09-21 09:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
28112807	4147073315	@alexhutton btw, I learned last week that State of MT is using the NIST RMF, and effectively at that... maybe that's a better ref model...	2009-09-21 09:09:00				Phoenix, AZ

28112807	4147766837	@wadew ah, but every time I restart @TweetDeck then the errors clear... it's FB API, tho, to be certain... they limit to 1 login active...	2009-09-21 10:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
28112807	4147775267	@wadew this 1 login limit is idiotic because it prohibits using a tool to track status while interacting via web... :S	2009-09-21 10:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
28112807	4151794744	I hate it when shell scripts work well for a month and then suddenly stop working wo any good reason... *sigh*	2009-09-21 13:09:00				Phoenix, AZ

7482152	4112207594	Does anyone have a favorite Red Velvet Cake recipe to send/link me? Going to make one this weekend, for my birthday.	2009-09-19 18:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4113097157	I'm going to use a recipe very close to the "original" Waldorf Red Velvet Cake recipe I keep finding online. Gotta head to the store, first.	2009-09-19 19:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4116182262	@zackmann In my experience, the price on the sign is for cash purchases only, in those cases.	2009-09-19 21:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4116195961	Sigh. Red Velvet Cake fail. I think I'm going to go out and get a store-bought cake, after all. Or ... just not have cake for my birthday?	2009-09-19 21:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4116834398	Haven't gotten past the opening credits of Tales of Monkey Island Ep. 1 & already I've lost interest. Glad it was free.	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4116895488	Hmmm... In addition, dialog choices seem irrelevant to both what takes place & what gets said. Sad. #talesofmonkeyisland	2009-09-19 22:09:00				Phoenix, AZ

7482152	4120342638	Do I start with all the people I actually know? The people who, knowing me in 'real life' don't want to follow me on Twitter?	2009-09-20 03:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4120415080	@PIOGreg I'm not there yet, but having something in mind before hitting Twitter's ratio limits (~2k+ following) seems a good idea.	2009-09-20 03:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4120523841	I wonder about 'strategy'... I don't think I'm very good at it, in a conventional way.	2009-09-20 03:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4140785323	I feel a lot of tension in my neck. Have you heard I'll "be" 31 years old in an hour and a half? Birthday, again. Like a forgotten holiday.	2009-09-21 00:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4140913155	@beanchef No problem; I ended up with a strange (mauve-ish) cake with lumpy frosting. Delicious, because I'm a better baker than the recipe.	2009-09-21 00:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
7482152	4140921013	@BlaqueSaber Thanks. Yeah, I keep telling people it's another 30 years or so before I start to get old.	2009-09-21 00:09:00				Phoenix, AZ
