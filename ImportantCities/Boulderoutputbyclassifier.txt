36417438	2820346511	Still, the night ended well enough. After @nicholasandros and @glenbateman took off, I found a way to cheer up @fran_goldsmith.	2009-07-24 10:39:05				Boulder, CO
36417438	2820326495	But then, what if @glenbateman was right? What if @motherabigail is our 'white magic' to fight off the dark man out west? And we lost her.	2009-07-24 10:37:54				Boulder, CO
36417438	2820281121	I think he was scarin' @fran_goldsmith. Talkin' of dark magic, dragons, and trolls. And somethin' about a 'lifetrip'. Damn professors.	2009-07-24 10:35:17				Boulder, CO
36417438	2820250298	Now I believe in some... superstition. Keep them black cats and ladders outta my way, yeah. But take out all rational anything? I can't.	2009-07-24 10:33:29				Boulder, CO
36417438	2820239764	The rational age has passed, or some shit. That's what @glenbateman put forth. More of a question, but still somethin' I didn't take to.	2009-07-24 10:32:51				Boulder, CO
36417438	2820183219	I followed it, I think. @glenbateman said things aren't rational anymore. Captain Trips. The dreams. We don't know for sure what's what.	2009-07-24 10:29:40				Boulder, CO
36417438	2820169060	We all sat down last night, as there isn't much to do once darkness falls, and talked. @glenbateman shared some things about rational stuff.	2009-07-24 10:28:49				Boulder, CO
36417438	2819969633	...she just worries about me. It's nice, but I told @fran_goldsmith, I'm not the one to fret over right now. #thestand	2009-07-24 10:16:58				Boulder, CO
36417438	2819950749	...relieved, like she thought I'd be lost too out there. You'd have thought I was the one in danger, not @motherabigail. @fran_goldsmith...	2009-07-24 10:15:52				Boulder, CO
36417438	2819936811	The first day, we all went. Even @haroldlauder came with that afternoon. We were gone a while. When I got home, @fran_goldsmith seemed...	2009-07-24 10:15:03				Boulder, CO
36417438	2819907797	So we searched. @nicholasandros joined us for a while, but he headed back after the first day to take care of things in town. #thestand	2009-07-24 10:13:15				Boulder, CO
36417438	2819883987	But why would any grown man, the likes of a sociology prof such as @glenbateman pull any stunt like that? No, she was gone. #thestand	2009-07-24 10:11:48				Boulder, CO
36417438	2819870657	I was at the power plant w/ @nicholasandros when @glenbateman came ridin' in on his hog to tell us she was missin'. I thought he was jokin'.	2009-07-24 10:11:01				Boulder, CO
36417438	2819844073	Another night down and still no sign of her. @motherabigail's left a few days back and we don't know where she went. #thestand	2009-07-24 10:09:27				Boulder, CO
36417438	2798079943	Wonder when the world's gonna give us a break. We finally get it together and all hell breaks loose. Been an exhausting couple of days.	2009-07-23 08:35:05				Boulder, CO
36417438	2757681006	Especially late at night... the world's quieter than it was before. Suits me fine. Let's a man think. So I walked for a while. #thestand	2009-07-21 08:27:32				Boulder, CO
36417438	2757665500	After we argued about sending spies west, I took a good walk around Boulder. Even with all the new people, it's pretty empty. #thestand	2009-07-21 08:26:19				Boulder, CO
36417438	2757654585	Interesting past few days, I gotta say. @fran_goldsmith and I are talkin', but things ain't fully back to normal. If normal's still around.	2009-07-21 08:25:28				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678347614	@fran_goldsmith Frannie? Frannie.. I didn'... (dammit). Alright. I'll... take a stroll. You holler if you ... if you need me.	2009-07-16 18:28:59				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678331327	@fran_goldsmith I love you and I'll back you until the end of days... but I gotta go with my gut on this spy business.	2009-07-16 18:27:50				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678320549	@fran_goldsmith Aw, Frannie, I didn't mean to make you cry.	2009-07-16 18:27:06				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678195377	@fran_goldsmith But if that's the way you see it Frannie, then we'll just have to see it different. But I'm still gonna bring it up to them.	2009-07-16 18:18:40				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678165087	@fran_goldsmith ... I think we ought to find out if that's the case. For all we know, he's got spies here in Boulder.	2009-07-16 18:16:38				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678146020	@fran_goldsmith I have this feelin' that while we've been havin' parties and formin' committees, the dark man's been building an army...	2009-07-16 18:15:22				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678116821	@fran_goldsmith Yeah... he might notice spies. But it's a risk worth takin. And I won't be the only committee member sayin' this, I reckon.	2009-07-16 18:13:24				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678099332	@fran_goldsmith Of course you matter, Frannie. We all do. Especially now.	2009-07-16 18:12:18				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678083697	@fran_goldsmith ... and when I'm too tired to watch the mountains, I crawl into bed with you and I hold you as tight as I can.	2009-07-16 18:11:15				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678072833	@fran_goldsmith I stand and watch the moutains while you sleep. Every night. And I wait. For somethin'... a missile... an army... I wait...	2009-07-16 18:10:31				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678062217	@fran_goldsmith You can say I won't lose you, but maybe we see different things when we look west. I see danger and I start to worry for ya.	2009-07-16 18:09:51				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678046910	@fran_goldsmith They're not "fresh meat". No one would probably notice them. They'd blend in and hopefully come back to report later on.	2009-07-16 18:08:49				Boulder, CO
36417438	2678029966	@fran_goldsmith I know that. No one wants to lose anymore people. No one. But... we need to be sure that they're leavin' us alone.	2009-07-16 18:07:42				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677992222	@fran_goldsmith  ... I can't lose you.	2009-07-16 18:05:14				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677988833	@fran_goldsmith ... and I can't stand by and wait for him. I'm not gonna just let it happen. I can't lose you, Frannie!	2009-07-16 18:05:01				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677980195	@fran_goldsmith You think that devil's gonna stop where he is? Do you? Dammit, Frannie, he's gonna come for all of us, I know he is...	2009-07-16 18:04:27				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677954736	@fran_goldsmith And I knew you wouldn't like the idea --- which I why I wanted to talk about it alone first with just you, to talk it out.	2009-07-16 18:02:45				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677917937	@fran_goldsmith We need to make sure that those bastards out there aren't plannin' to come for us, Frannie. Spies are the way to do that.	2009-07-16 18:00:23				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677902210	@fran_goldsmith It might be a death sentence --- you think I don't know that? I know that... I ... we need to watch out for ourselves.	2009-07-16 17:59:23				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677890163	@fran_goldsmith ... who could handle themselves in that situation.	2009-07-16 17:58:34				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677883815	@fran_goldsmith Whoa, Frannie... I'm just thinkin' that we need to see what's really goin' out there. I'm sure there are people here who ...	2009-07-16 17:58:09				Boulder, CO
36417438	2677826051	@fran_goldsmith Now I haven't told this to @glenbateman or the others, but I think the first thing we do is send some people... spies, west.	2009-07-16 17:54:19				Boulder, CO

23195101	4070869793	For a while I've been thinking about the relationship between computer science, philosophy and language documentation.	2009-09-17 22:09:00				Boulder, CO
23195101	4070912550	"The Examined Life" spoke about neither computers nor linguistics, but the philosophers' discussions drew me towards this idea anyway.	2009-09-17 22:09:00				Boulder, CO
23195101	4070947201	I'd like to explore this relationship. I don't know of anybody who really has in depth as of yet, so there should be much room for thought.	2009-09-17 22:09:00				Boulder, CO
23195101	4080386726	I love baroque music, so I was happy to buy "The 99 Most Essential Baroque Masterpieces" via @amazonMP3 for just $1.99. http://bit.ly/Nh9Xn	2009-09-18 10:09:00				Boulder, CO
23195101	4083777197	@stargalasia Wow! Baroque is one of my two favorite varieties of classical music. The music of J.S. Bach in particular always moves me.	2009-09-18 12:09:00				Boulder, CO

23195101	4096685767	@stargalasia Have you seen "Un très long engagement," Jeunet's next film with Tautou? Worth seeing, but I do still prefer "Amélie."	2009-09-18 23:09:00				Boulder, CO
23195101	4097087661	I thought "Stingray Sam" was hilarious! I need more space cowboy musicals in my life, it seems. http://bit.ly/XjUo6	2009-09-19 00:09:00				Boulder, CO
