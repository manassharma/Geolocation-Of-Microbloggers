14287342	5600190228	@Daimoku7 B/c COD 4's online gaming has continued to be unrivaled by my opinion. They can have their money, they won't get mine though.	2009-11-10 15:41:13				Columbus, Ohio
14287342	5600168950	@Daimoku7 RIght, I know they are in business to make money. That just isn't something I find entertaining. Like I said, its a shame.	2009-11-10 15:40:22				Columbus, Ohio
14287342	5600034368	@Daimoku7 But those are my personal views.	2009-11-10 15:35:02				Columbus, Ohio
14287342	5600010546	@Daimoku7 Because I was really looking forward to the game. COD 4 really set a new standard for online gaming. I'll keep playing that. :)	2009-11-10 15:34:05				Columbus, Ohio
14287342	5599992727	@Daimoku7 My kids don't go near these types of games period. But as a gamer - I have conflicts about the games content. That sucks.	2009-11-10 15:33:23				Columbus, Ohio
14287342	5599973916	@Daimoku7 True, parents have the duty to not allow children to play things like this. But I'm a parent, and I play. This isn't about my kids	2009-11-10 15:32:37				Columbus, Ohio
14287342	5599188291	@sktjr169 I think even more than translation, its just excessive poor taste to move that type of an atrocity into "entertainment". My view.	2009-11-10 15:01:18				Columbus, Ohio

14318420	5661772265	@kisofotografia LOL!  No, don't need those thanks!  But if it were easier to burn the whole thing and they were included, oh well.	2009-11-12 16:29:08				Columbus, OH
14318420	5661713437	@kisofotografia Interesting.  thanks for the input - I was just curious what winds up being easier.	2009-11-12 16:26:52				Columbus, OH
14318420	5661696507	@kisofotografia It would be weird even if the planner designed the whole wedding?	2009-11-12 16:26:13				Columbus, OH
14318420	5661656399	@kisofotografia i would think it would be WAY more work for photographers to find each picture and burn it individually versus dumping it.	2009-11-12 16:24:43				Columbus, OH

14318420	5661409808	@kisofotografia Sorry, I have a thing about stock photos on a wedding vendor's website. It is misleading and dishonest to potential clients.	2009-11-12 16:15:12				Columbus, OH
14318420	5661363896	? for photogs: is it easier when a planner goes through and picks out specific pictures from a wedding or to burn the whole wedding for us?	2009-11-12 16:13:26				Columbus, OH
14318420	5661004415	I guess if you have to use stock photos, you at least picked photos that look like they could have been our weddings. Still feels dishonest.	2009-11-12 15:59:45				Columbus, OH
