@severshed Can I get the view that goes along with it  
Macys the pinnacle of organic brand integration for over a century 
Apples Lapurchase forecasts browser access to iTunes content 
@audio @rc I use my 4Cs If you deliver relevant CONTENT youll COMPEL the right audience  CONNECT meaningfully to CONVERT them to brand
@rc Right Understanding intent  crafting relevant messaging around it are the steps you take to get to ROI  the conversion continuum
@rc I may intend to buy but it doesnt count as a result or success until I actually buy it Metrics refinement against tangible return
@rc This whole discussion stemmed from impressions vs actions as a metric in which case intent  return Theres no ROI on intent alone
@rc I could argue that if youve done a good enough job targeting  profiling your consumer you know the intent  can use to drive action
@audio Agreed  in that manner you invest in the relationship to deliver resonant behaviordriving content  Sparked intent gt conversion
@audio Were still saying different things Intent to buy is not the same as actually buying it We need to measure actions not intentions
@audio My stance is centered around random mass push vs tailoring efforts to reaching the right audience Latterless views greater return
@audio But that goes back to my original point about reaching targeted viewers vs unqualified eyeballs See Im strategic like that 
Measuring intents virtually useless Measure action Doesnt matter if consumers intend to do something Matters when they actually do it
@kmullett Right 10k relevant viewsinfinitely better than 100k wholl never convert to brand Too many chase mainstream vs nurturing niche
@filmfuturist Agree Prob is megabrands w to orchestrate a transmedia initiative are tightening the purse strings after failed attempts
@MarcHustvedt Re Moochie not sure if I guessed right but it forced me to pay attention to content I otherwise wouldnt have 
I just took a guess on the hidden brand sponsor Do you agree  Lets Play Can You Spot the Brand Target Moochie 
@filmfuturist Agree itll help put the experience in focus but there have been transmedia successes This is still largely a niche strategy
@filmfuturist I heave that sigh on a daily basis Focus must be on creating compelling content viewers will want to championengage deeper
@filmfuturist That hasnt been my experience bc agencies usually tout impressions as the success metric vs engagementaction
@filmfuturist 100 correct Its much easier to promise views than orchestrate a multifaceted experience that actually engages viewers
@filmfuturist Theyre using views as a way to squeeze maximum  out of clients but when campaign ultimately fails brands blame branded ent
Manufactured buzz is not a success metric
I often say some of the most successful branded entertainment campaigns out there youve probably never heard of bc youre not the target
@jasonzada Right but millions of unqualified views wont advance the brand The key is to create resonant content for the right audience
@filmfuturist Of course not You can easily identify those schemes when its 100k views  3 comments Those guarantees hurt the category
@kmullett Exactlyanyone can inflate views but it wont drive results if theyre not relevant to the brand or actually engage wthe content

Awesome new transmedia web series Mental Beast launched today Check out ep1 audio  watch the prologue video too 
Interesting stats  Internets multifaceted nature makes it more compelling  something TV cannot match  ht @maince
@Lukester Thanks for getting back to me so quickly Just DMd you the handles in question Let me know if I should open a support ticket

NBCComcast Deal Puts Broadcast TV in Doubt 
@EaonP I have the same random issue but it usually sorts itself out after a few refreshes Guess that doesnt help the flummoxing eh 
@TomKonkle Dont we all my friend Dont we all
@wrighteous1 You know Im the transmedia police  Agree re viewer insights on traversing platforms  key to drive synergiesconsumption
@wrighteous1 I was merely pointing out that simply a web series moving over to TV does not make it a transmedia experience
@wrighteous1 Yes I know Sofias Diary Its def more prevalent overseas but is happening here too Even Heroes did a transmedia extension
@wrighteous1 Im a big fan of niche segments  cable is certainly perfect for that Id like to see more mediainterlinking stories though20091206 235942
@wrighteous1 But moving from web to TV or TV to web isnt transmedia Valemonts the only real example The rest are merely crossplatform20091206 235741
@televisual But theres no pro forma to use as a case study yet Sanctuary  Secret Girlfriend are unique Valemont could be a good subject20091206 235216
@televisual Yes theres major crossover happening for several reasons As digital convergence continues media lines will blur even more20091206 235021
@JSto Its likely the only silver lining in the merger and most definitely a game changer when it comes to content distribution20091206 230128
@charmfx At the core indie has always been about circumventing congloms  rigid structures to allow the art form to flourish unfettered20091206 224736
@charmfx I think those are valid points among many others Corp politics around proddistro  risk aversion also spawn indie creation20091206 224644
Comedy Central Bets Big On Web Development 20091206 224114

There are few things stranger than wandering around your own home trying to figure out the source of the Michael Jackson music And failing20091112 234929
 on a Thursday afternoon and I have yet to put on a pair of pants Today life is good
Things my ass has been called Enormous Spectacular Astronomical All adjectives that I can really get behind
Remember when poking someone on Facebook meant that you wanted to fuck them I guess my mom doesnt either
It doesnt really matter how many times you step on them Twizzlers still taste great
Dear Kitten I know they may be chopping your balls off but dont worry youll still be the bestest most testosteroneridden man I know
Drugs Make sure YOU do THEM before THEY do YOU
It smells like caterpillars and used diapers in here WTF20091102 225309
Kitten has decided he likes to play with garbage I think maybe this is true love
Dear Mucinex You make cool things come out of me Signed Holy crap Ive never seen that color before
If youre bored try adding hole to any combination of words Good times will then pour forth from the hilarity hole
@luciferous I cant help but work with the tools God gave me
Nothing reminds me of love more than multicolored mucus pouring from my face orifices on a cold winters day
I miss watching MTVHits drunk and alone at 3am without any pants on
Kittens are assholes Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying or being held at gunpoint by a kitten
I didnt know how much owning a kitten is like having a baby until I realized how many pictures Ive taken of him already
When people ask me how Im doing I can never bring myself to answer well I think its because I love America so goddamn much
Today I think I will wear the tshirt MOST suited to my position as betterthanyou used bookstore employee And skinny jeans
@luciferous I need to make sure he can hear me pooping
I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME POOPING DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR
I think my flesheating disease is going into remission Now how will I scare the children
@luciferous Your @reply was so much better in my mind20091021 221348
Hypothetical conversations are always so much better than real ones
I liked him better in the 90s He was way more punk rock than yoga then
@cdashiell Except everyone I know thats my age BUT me loves them So yes clearly thats a factor
Is it really something awful to say that I just dont reallycare about the Beatles
Dear God Internet who do I have to blow around here to get someone to post the new episode of Mad Men20091018 231620
Why are people always so sensitive about children In my opinion theyre not tall enough to count
Just like jumping jacks cocaine and nonalcoholic beer I just dont think Ill ever get the point of dating20091017 214150
I love argyle but hate hives WHY
Today was weird Time to do some drugs20091015 204839
The smell of alcohol on breath always makes me think of being in love
Its only the creepy old guys that want to talk to me on the BART but I wonder will they still want me when Im a creepy old lady
Touring Napa with the family Odds are my mom will end up wearing the lamp shade
Well if hes just a dick and you grew some balls then youd be the perfect couple
Its 3 AM and all I want to know is why am I still wearing pants
Listening to music that reminds me of WV isnt enough to make me stop missing it I wonder if anyone sexy in my zip code shares DNA with me
The best thing about kittens is everything20091006 234421
When it comes to the 90s there is no such thing as a greatest hit20091005 201522

Not a good night
Use the gifts and wisdom within you to transform the environment around you
Dont look to others to define you You run the risk of depending on destroyers for validation  Know respect  love yourself
Test what you hear by your inner wisdom  Just because something is spoken doesnt mean it is true  The truth rises
Dont settle for just looking good  Its time for wellness wholeness and freedom
If you only speak to a person when you need something the relationship cant last  Instead of seeking to get start to give
When you try 2 soar people will be drawn to u  Your responsibility is separating the dream supporters from the dream blockers
Break the cycles of dysfunction in your family  Turn the page and be made whole
You are capable  Be a trailblazer  Rise up and be who you were born to be
Resist depression isolation and bitterness  Claim peace joy and gratitude
Count your blessings and name them one by one
Make a decision today to be a point of light love compassion truth and joy
@jamesbosticii  Thanks for the question  Use moments of silence music reading and things that nurture and grow you
Be thankful that the race you have run has been difficult but it has not destroyed you  Walking miracle you are blessed
Your attitude decisions and actions are speaking much louder than any words
Do well with the challenges of today  You will be prepared to easily cross the valley tomorrow
Give yourself a retreat  a spiritual psychological season of refreshing20091125 223139
You can rise from your past  Its a new season and a new you20091125 203948
You were made to manifest excellence  Be all that you are
Calm yourself  Its not that deep that it should steal your peace
Dont take peoples attitudes personally  Thats their stuff so dont take it in
Reach out to someone  Your call embrace invitation could set a captive heart free
Look back to where you were this time several years ago  Give thanks  Youve come a long way  youre still here
Today International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women Claim peace in attitude conversation  relationships
Release stress let go of negativity brush your shoulders off  Each moment presents an opportunity to reshape your life
The way you start the day sets the pace for your day  Center yourself breathe appreciate the gift of the present moment
Over the course of your life the muscle that does the most work is your heart  Keep believing hoping  pressing
You are not a puppet  Dont let people pull your strings  Think for yourself and follow your spirit20091124 210822
Know what you want or you will end up accepting anything and complaining about everything
@hrtanya @lynnwashington @jamesbosticii @xtuddabaybee @arealzeta @lauriekit @hollawal@tawandat23 @ptahshadow @amberthebeau Thanks 4 RT
@deshawnsnow @lthepoet @godscovergirl @Marketingchoice @hotmommie1 @mzbutterfly @msfrenchkiss13 @gweplanning @missninab4eva Thanks 4 RTFly
You are intelligent beautiful creative powerful worthy precious Live like you know it
It is often easier to see the negative  Make a decision to see the solution the positive  the progress in yourself  others
Stand up for the silenced oppressed discouraged  Speak out for something larger than yourself 
Humor is healing  If you cant laugh at the ridiculosity of the situation laugh because your breakthrough is coming
You can turn things around  Be encouraged and take action in hope and faith
The true error is not in making a mistake but in refusing to take responsibility for it
You do not control others behavior but you do choose how to respond  Claim your peace and selfrespect
Be confident enough to feel good about yourself without needing to put others down  Cutting others down diminishes your crown
Dance to your own rhythm  The world is hungry for those willing to live outside the box20091123 222813
Be a person who keeps their word  Once broken trust is difficult to rebuild

Marion Barber owners should start looking for someone to fill his shoes  
Not a Happy Day for Romo  Dallas Fans Is there anyone on the planet aging faster than Jerry Jones  Al Davis Sure was a good game though
Oh Yeah I got Chris Johnson as my 1st pick
Sproles is Da Man Get him if you still can I picked him in the 5th round and people thought I was nuts
Brady D J Russel D Favre B Quinn F Warner A Palmer B M Ryan A
Seems LT stands for Lost Time One thing after another with him Sproles Da Man 
Gone Zalez up to 8 weeks out Bummer for the Colts Maybe Baskett can step it up 
Dont rule out McNabb yet Hes trying to play How effective can he be with sore ribs 
There is a treat in you Baskett With Colts fire power this could be a good pick up 
LT gets the Boot Get Sproles if you can It looks like we might be seeing a lot of him 
No Mayo please Patriots LB Mayo out 68 weeks with MCL tear Looks like more points for Thomas Jones Owners this week20090916 230425
Got Crab Looks like the Niners Presidento wants to work things out Could be a sleeper 
Top Chief may need more time resting in his Cassel before returning to play 20090915 223351
Raider Fan just cant get any love inda house Nomore Monday Night King for them Im thinking Al Davis just added another wrinkle
Raiders holding off Chargers Who would have thunk Close game but I do think the Raiders got ripped on that TD called back20090914 233819
RIP Patrick Swayze 
McRibs anyone Dont jump to quick on the Vick bandwagon McNabb might be OK 
Looks like it might be time to Cut Cutler At least bench him for next week against Pitt He will look like an Ass Clown against them20090913 231455
Kick that Ball
OMG I cant sleepTomorrow I wake up a Fantasy Freak Got beer on ice  my teams on callTry  think of a way to send my wife to the mall
Ben Rotheatsburgers may not look so smooth but he finds a way to gitterdun Reminds me of Jim Plunkett a bit That was a fun Raider Team
That Pitt D was bad ass Good game overall
And were off Let the games and Beer Drinking begin
Almost time to Funk it up Can Chris Johnson tear down the Steel Curtain Should be a great game I predict Tenn 27  Pitt 17
It is Count Down Time Good Luck to everyone during this Football Season Cold Beers Potato Chips and Laptops Life is just a Fantasy
Feeling the tension build as tomorrow the season begins Fantasy Football Freaks it is time to rumble Try to spend some time with the Fam
Seymour to Raiders But the Raiders release Garcia They really think Jamarcus is a team leader Raider fans must be pissed
Sippin on Gin  Juice OJ to stay in prison durring appeal But hes such a likeable guy Hope he enjoys his Pruno20090904 233102
Favre fined 10k for illegal Crack
No more getting Dogged around by the NFL Vick to only miss 2 games Time will tell but I dont see this as a good mix
Canned by Canada Pacman a No Go Time to Busacap
Pacman Chomps his way into Canada Do Canadians even watch Canada Football
More Bad News for Da Raida Fans Asomugha out for possibly 2 weeks Is this just more Al Davis bad Karma Holy Hole in a Doughnut Batman
So Favre so good for Mr Fav Ray Looks like the Old Timers got game Think he might put off retirement for a few more games20090831 203709
Now Farvre says hes hurt I cant take anymore Remember the 80s song All Cried Out by Lisa Lisa  Cult Jam Play Ping Pong already
What do you think people Does Cutler Cut Up Denver It has the feel of a playoff game
For the Saints the game was just a Brees This guy stays healthy and he has a better year than last Sorry Raider Fan gonna be a long year
Tommy Boy takes a slam to the ground 20090828 232442
Have a good Friday night everyone Really excited about the Football Season Cold Beers  Smooth Drinks  some Bone Breaking Action

@briandigital @dasmart @DaleStrumpell front page links fixed now to have specific iTunes 9 links for the aacPlus streams ram is for VLC
@schwell add more capacity as needed but the servers didnt fill up today Its all about bandwidth costs and budgets sorry
Mac Users we changed the links on the front page for the aacPlus feeds there is now a iTunes 9 link and a VLC link which is a ram file
@schwe banned all the stream rippers There were hundreds of streamripping clients camped on the streams wasting bandwidth
@elenion There seem to be some internetwide backbone issues today affecting some listeners more than others
@DaleStrumpell Use the links in iTunes Radio
The internet just burped Or at least some of the backbones did Caused us to be partially off air for 5 minutes back now
The aacPlus 48k feed of Indie Pop Rocks sounds better that the 128k MP3 feed And iTunes 9 radio plays aacPlus now Give it a listen
Weve added capacity to some servers Lush IPR aacPlus feeds but you may need to launch the channels from SomaFMcom to get them

Personally though I love what the guy can do with his voicejust saying His range is ridiculous  Like him or not that bitch can sing
And GG Allin took a shit on stage back in the 80swaitok thats pretty shockingLOL
Keep in mind I dont have kids and I am certainly no role model but Marilyn Manson was 15 years ago were we even shocked back then
I wasnt shocked all all by Adam Lambert on the AMAs We all knew EXACTLY what kind of performer he was Why is everyone is focused on it
I think I am started to get bored by all the artists making pop music right now  I feel like Its all been done before
Doors at 730 Were on at 1030

APE the Alternative Press Expo swings into San Francisco on October 17
While no more Preview Night badges are currently available regular fourday memberships are still available
so we made available fourday memberships with and without the Preview Night option
It is impossible to accommodate every person who registers for a fourday badge on Preview Night
Because of the increasing number of attendees on Preview Night each year we have decided to limit attendance for Preview Night in 2010 
We will begin selling online advanced registration for 2010 in a few weeks So hang tight for ComicCon 2010
but we wanted to give props to everyone who attended We couldnt do it without each one of you Thanks so much everyone
A really REALLY big thank you to all who made ComicCon the best place to be last weekend Were blurry eyed as Im sure you all are too

@crasis Regardless of who it was Im sure the roaring success of the Bay movies likely made an easy and scary decision

I like Philip calling TO right now  Dont need to waste a down at this stage
Chargers defense looks tired  Offense needs to put it together next time they are on the field
Chargers need to force a turnover
McNabb is tearing apart the coverage with all this open space  Someone hit him please

@zephoria Webstock were great with me but if they hadnt been so supportive then my medium good talk could have been a catastrophe

@seldo How come I follow 380 people but mainly because I know or care about what theyre doing Is that so wrong
@brendanquinn My talks for example seem on the whole to go down pretty well with people but without notes  slides Id not do them
@brendanquinn If we limit public speaking to people who can riff epic speeches off the top of their heads then well lose a lot of voices
@brendanquinn Thats great but surely the aspiration is that very good thinkers are supported in giving good talks by any means necessary
I have so much respect to @zephoria for writing that up I get tense before talks and need props to survive In her place I would combust

@plasticbagUK If hes suggesting 500000 digital subscribers each day hes having a laugh The Timess daily circ is around 600k
@FISG I block them when I can be bothered but its more principle than because they cause irritation its not like I follow them back
@drewb @benjamincohen but also remember follower number doesnt necessarily mean a lot Lots of spambots out there for example
@tombot18 Calm down dear its just a commercial But do you get your money back when your call to god goes unanswered
@drewb @benjamincohen Her Twitter focus  PR gives a useful boost But she also follows more people replies to more broadcasts less

@plasticbagUK in what way did it change
@DanGriffiths OK now Ive seen it and it is predictably sensationalist invasive and selfserving Hope shes doing OK

@darrenwaters Very cynical indeed But does PM really have expectation of privacy in conversation with a member of public I dont think so
@kieren In this case its distasteful but I think elected reps  particularly leaders  lose that right when talking about public issues
@jemimakiss I dont like the way it was orchestrated but I dont think what the prime minister says to member of public should be private

sm101 lesson Its not a good idea to piss off and attack members of a community who could be good promoters of your service
@susanbeebe theres no twitter standards body though so I expect everyone to do it as they want just explaining what I am doing now  why20091110 230928
@susanbeebe so my thinking is the slash is ALL that follows in a domain name space parlance 2  the period is the terminus20091110 230837
thinking the  symbol represents the root or all subdomains20091110 220336
and i just decided that I want to use the beginning slash instead of a period when making certain replies public to all my followers20091110 220227

@Pagely @CoryOBrien if it means I dont have to hack up a 140 char tweet to fit it in thats the only improvement I really need20091110 203942

@tonybgoode we must model the behaviour we want to see in the world by living it  teaching others how to attribute properly
@tonybgoode for a very small percentage there is the legal system for everyone else we only have our community
@tonybgoode by talking about the responsibility we have to not do that and pointing it out respectfully when we see it done
Tried to do downward dog pose and had shooting level 12 pain in heel Ouch Is that sciattaca or what thatsnew
@tonybgoode cool visual but we need to also talk about the reality of the problem from time to time to bring awareness to it

@missrogue feeling bad for them because they steal doesnt stop them from getting rewarded for stealing  calling it out is only way
@missrogue feeling bad for assholes who build their rep using others ideas is like feeling bad for the murderer who got blood on his shirt
@jtag it hinders the process because more people accept what is in front of them without seeking broader context and deeper insights
 @leweb Only a few hours left to get your ticket to LeWeb with Earlybird or Group discount 
anyhoo  gotta get to the gym and get to work  busy day blogging and writing proposals and getting ready for upcoming events
@missrogue its just unfortunate that there are bad actors in the system who exploit people like VPs who take credit for their teams work
@missrogue and when the thoughts you create are stolen by others for them to create their own social capital getting credit does matter
@missrogue its not only what you do its what you think and say in a knowledge economy that creates social capital
@missrogue some people are purposefully stealing credit to get the social capital it happens all the time in this business so it matters

@justyn well for me the venting helps sometimes just so it doesnt eat me up inside what we are forced to deal with
@KellyThul definitely thinking about the droid but Im in love with the iphone just not the way ATT provides service to it
@kristiewells well that means only one of us is locked into ATT now so our cancellation fee when we switch to verizon will be lower
@JustinHerman we are so tired of ATTs bs its just been too many years of this so far with little to no change or improvement
i just dont want to be locked into att any more only reason I am today is because of steve jobs and apple time for something different
the thing about all this venom for ATT isnt this one instance its the way we have been treated all these years and will be treated
the funnier thing is that my phone is eligible for an upgrade but kristies which was activated 2 weeks earlier then mine is not
this is really the last straw with all the billing mistakes the lockin the poor support if they didnt have the iphone
we spend almost 400 per month with ATT right now no longer
hey @ATTTimur thanks for nothing doesnt do you any good to be on twitter if you still treat customers the same byebye ATT

AJ Smith should get lambasted for carrying Brandyn Dombrowski on the roster He may be the worst player in the NFL
Dumb mistakes by SDs DBs just gifted the Eagles 7 points Stupid penalty by Gregory and blown assignment by Cason This game is too close
Get hookup between Rivers and Naanee for LNs first score of the season but that celebration flag is a killer SD had all the momentum
LT has his second twoTD games in the last three weeks his latest score spotting San Diego a 15point lead
A great playcalling game by Norv takes a hit when he goes to Sproles on thirdand1 Why not go with LT Hester or Tolbert there SMH
LT runs in his fourth TD of the season from 4 yards out He needs six more scores this year to keep his streak of 10TD seasons alive
San Diegos defense comes up with two threeandouts in the first quarter This unit is making bigtime progress
Wow that first TD drive was a playcalling masterpiece by Norv The Wildcat with Legedu and the screen to Tolbert Just beautiful
Nick Hardwick Tim Dobbins and Jyles Tucker are among San Diegos inactives today 
Chargers fans already know what GM AJ Smith should do in next years NFL Draft 20091114 233810
See the weeks complete injury report for both the Chargers and the Eagles 20091114 232107
We check in with a midseason report before the biggest twogame swing of the season 20091114 211643
The Chargers have already shown interest in this 2010 RB prospect Could he be LTs heir apparent 
Kranz is back with some dish on San Diegos finds in the undrafted free agent market 20091111 214043
SD  the only AFC West team to win  is back in the thick of things 
Someone needs to remind Ron Rivera that Shaun Phillips is his best passrusher Hes spending WAY too much time in coverage
Now this is where a championship offense needs to make a statement A 10play sixminute TD drive would put the Giants in a tough spot
See what Chargers fans are saying in the ingame message board thread 
At least three Giants linemen held on that 29yard catchandrun by Hakeem Nicks Cant believe none of them drew a flag
See what happens Gates You drop two passes and the Chargers go to Kris Wilson in the red zone instead

Great interface on the new BB @Seesmic app but the fact that it only manages one account kills the deal Cant migrate Staying Uber
@snarkyblogger That blows me away If youre going to compete with the best existing app you have to at least match them in base features

@harrythehat9007 can you give me exact steps on howwhen this happens
@harrythehat9007 Im looking into it We have no problem when we all were in the same party at the same time here
@WillAllon Im looking into it for you I know we dont normally support that but there may be a way for you to do it
@venomblade yes set both UDP and TCP 
@Micr0mancer Which levels are you referring to Taurus is pretty chill and Eloise is a slow boat but he should move when he needs to
@WillAllon Im not sure Whats the issue I can look into it if you want
@venomblade ports assuredly do matter 3074 UDPTCP also check for firmware updates for your router
@D351 Im going to forward that on It may not be till the end of the day as I have to see who exactly I need to send that to
@MyHairyNutz What happens exactly There shouldnt be anything that causes a crash on consoles
@D351 if its just a suggestion go ahead and send it to me here and Ill include it in my emails at the end of the day
@AcedogAG Unfortunately as its a PS3 hardware issue I am limited to the suggestions I can come up with
@aslansrevenge I cannot speak for other parties but I do get backed up sometimes and can miss or reply slowly
@Freyar did you install the Windows 7 drivers for your XFi card from Soundblaster 
@BlackRainNinja I think @ATVIBernard might have an inflated view of his own abilities in the game
@aslansrevenge we dont have direct control over those things but we always forward those requests to the people than handle that stuff
@BlackRainNinja ill include that in my email report for the day and have someone test it out
@Parisyte Ive tried it a few times here in the office As long as there is no vibrationmotion or disturbance it went into sleep
@Parisyte ironically enough weve had reports of cats running by keeping the controller on
@Parisyte It should sleep within 15 mins Make sure there is no motion at that time or disconnect the dongle
@Parisyte it should be negligible and  the same as the wireless remotes functionality
@chrsfrwll The game uses 3074 and 3478 and the game port is random
@Parisyte Which console The board should go into a sleep mode after a certain amount of time
@KenJeanis Could be a network hiccup not transferring data properly or dust finger prints scratches on the disk
@KenJeanis Hi Ken Im looking into it but usually errors like that are due to a bad data read of some sort
@AcedogAG Its happened to other companies and other games besides ours The game is more intensive and may expose issues with the console
@AcedogAG Its a fairly common association with the new hot games When these issues occur many users will automatically associate it
@AcedogAG Theres nothing in the code that can affect hardware failure If it was a game code issue all PS3s would fail across the board
@AcedogAG Hi Acedog can you give me specifics on what is occuring This should not be happening
@alanmwillis Hi Alan Lets start here  also if it continues let me know what region you live in and internet typeprovider
@skeezy28 Not to be glib but someone behind you
Lil bit of clarity regarding @ATVIAmbers mention of 105  was a reply not a typo That said no word of a new patch has come to support
@rainblood @ATVIAmbers reference to 105 was a typo Sorry
@BlackRainNinja The MW2 104 patch is part of the fix to the network functionality related to friend invites
@Seckinho Thats more of a dev question than support Keep an eye on @fourzerotwo for stuff like that
@boyle111 Take a look at OpenOfficeorg It might be able to help you out
@manesauro The MW2 104 patch is part of the fix to the network functionality related to friend invites
For those who have been asking grrrr the pie was from @Cafe50sWand it kind of tasted good so I went and bought another one
@Opi24 Funny how that works eh MW2 and fixing my Wii sensor bar did it for me
@PS3Attitude The MW2 104 patch is part of the fix to the network functionality related to friend invites
@Opi24 Yeah Im good Nothing pie related though  sick kid

@JakeKelly Ive worked with our QA group a lot and there is definitely a pleasure in early access
Hey @JakeKelly Glad to help where I can Im doing well Like school in summer  no class Been with ATVI nine years now
@WillAllon As responses go Im in the support biz and IW is in the makin games biz Itd hurt my feelings if IW starts doing support 
@WillAllon I realize theres been a lot of talk about those issues and its being discussed I just dont have anything to pass on now
@chrismann1981 Ah Can you DM your contact info Weve got you sorted out
@chrismann1981 Hey Chris Did you get our email
@WillAllon Your best bet is to follow @fourzerotwo and see if comments on it
@WillAllon Hey there I do remember I just dont have much of an answer for you Decisions like that are up to the devs
@agentm Thinkin of you right here 
@JakeKelly Also youre one of the most creatively profane people Ive talked to in a while Fnose was an exciting new twist on a classic
@JakeKelly  Some PC cheaters have been banned already  @fourzerotwo is prolly more up to date on than we are though
@JakeKelly No worries  if youre cool were cool Weve seen the reports about cheating in the game and IW is aware of it
Hi @JakeKelly  if you have a support question Im happy to help out If you just want to swear at us well block your tweets
@jkaria Sorry about the delay getting back to you I dont have press packs but our PR guys might You can email em at pr@activisioncom

@karembeuca Not shilling for the company here but if you havent tried it DJ Hero is fantastic
@chrismann1981 Thanks for the link I havent seen this with our internal units Ill into it when I get back to the office on Monday
@FactandFiction9 Matchmaking problems are almost always router based
@FactandFiction9 If the steps on the site dont work we can go a bit more in depth with your specific system
If you celebrate it have a Happy Thanksgiving If you dont stay calm and carry on
@rakoji What about stuttering before the freeze I know this is obvious but disc is clean and all Any other games giving you grief
@FactandFiction9 Prolly a NAT setting on the router Did you try the steps on activisioncomsupport Search connect  online
@jkaria Let me look into the press kits and get back to you
@R1Junkie1 What platform are you on Any routerNAT changes
@rakoji Does it freeze in a particular spot or mode Any stutter beforehand
@FactandFiction9 What kind of trouble are you having
@hugan Highly peculiar Maybe something on the ISP end but I doubt it I say roll with it and let me know if it goes out again
@JuDgECoD huh  I didnt have that problem Did you try clearing the browser cache What browser are you on anyway
@JuDgECoD Where does it time out I created an account a few minutes ago with no problem

PSA Call of Duty World at War PC 17 Patch is out Contains quite a few MP fixes
@chrismann1981 unfortunately Im not privy to the  whys when product builds are made so I cant really say what contibutes to end product
@hugan every game uses different protocols to avoid data conflicts If the direct connect works theres a config problem with your router
@chrismann1981 these kinda of things usually occur in the warehouse and shipping parts of the process As long as youre taken care of 
@Freyar open up a trouble ticket at  and attach a dxdiag and we can take a better look at the system
@Freyar I think we need to get more in depth here Can you go to  and submit a ticket and DXDIAG report Mention Twitter
@chrismann1981 It might be faster to go to the store though if thats an option
@chrismann1981 Hi Chris  sorry to hear your game was fouled up We can arrange a replacement if you like
@JuDgECoD Ive heard twitteritis can be serious Leads to swelling
@hugan try updating the firmware for your router What happens when you direct connect your PS3 to your modem
@harrythehat9007 Im still looking into it Determining 100 repro steps and looking into intended functionality of the lobbies
@rtjohnson The Nat type is configured by the current network conditions at the time from your PS3 to the PSN game matching and my fluctuate
