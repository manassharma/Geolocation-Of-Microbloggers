Palmer on the possible problems getting carries to three backs I have no idea but I cant imagine a better problem to have bengals
Scott was limited due to turf toe in the second half bengals
Benson on if he expects to share time I dont know If it wasnt like that before I dont know why it would be like that now bengals
Larry Johnson over the 100yard mark He has 107 yards on 22 carries bengals
Thats 10 penalties for 75 yards for the bengals
End of three from PBS  bengals 16 browns 7
browns will start on their own 40 after Graham kicks it out of bounds
Shayne Graham with a 28yard field goal with 50 seconds left in the third makes it bengals 16 browns 7
Its now a seasonhigh 84 yards on 15 carries for Larry Johnson bengals
Larry Johnsons seasonhigh is 82 yards He has 80 right now on 14 carries bengals
Brodney Poole has a head injury and his return is questionable browns
Brady Quinn with the 9yard QB draw And we have a game again bengals 13 browns 7
Brandon Johnson is shaken up bengals
browns with a little trickeration  Cribbs to Quinn for a 18 yard gain to the Bengals 32
And the Bengals now have as many penalty yards 55 as the browns have on offense 46
bengals RB Bernard Scott 65 yards has more yards than the browns offense
And the half opens with a holding penalty on the bengals
The 53yarder for Graham equals a career high bengals
Graham nails it from 53yards to make it bengals 13 browns 0
Palmer horse collared by Rogers and gets up after being down for a minute Penalty will allow Graham to try a long field goal

LJohnson 2 carries 22 yards Scott 5 carries 17 yards Palmer  3 of 4 for 14 yards and  also a 12yard scramble bengals

@Daimoku7 Bc COD 4s online gaming has continued to be unrivaled by my opinion They can have their money they wont get mine though
@Daimoku7 RIght I know they are in business to make money That just isnt something I find entertaining Like I said its a shame
@Daimoku7 But those are my personal views
@Daimoku7 Because I was really looking forward to the game COD 4 really set a new standard for online gaming Ill keep playing that 
@Daimoku7 My kids dont go near these types of games period But as a gamer  I have conflicts about the games content That sucks
@Daimoku7 True parents have the duty to not allow children to play things like this But Im a parent and I play This isnt about my kids
@sktjr169 I think even more than translation its just excessive poor taste to move that type of an atrocity into entertainment My view
@sktjr169 Especially in light of recent events Their last release was such a great game  sad to see this one take a jump into this territo
@sktjr169 True it does But still I think this move even topples anything that GTA has done with their releases
@Jmikeydarby1 Are you in Cbus

@sasasarah The worst hell do is give you his bitchface
@sasasarah Well first my hair is thankfully way too short Ask Kurt

@sasasarah Sure I used to do it for my sister when she was younger so I
@BillyTheBrime Did you see what she said to Santana I dont give a fuck what her hormones are doing shes crazy

@KitxKatxKai I should be but Im not Dont ask boo
@KitxKatxKai Hey someone has to be on the receiving end of all my non dbag behavior
@KitxKatxKai She definitely isnt Shes the most amazing person I know
@KitxKatxKai Santana She acts like a bitch sometimes because people expect her to She really isnt one though
@KitxKatxKai She is Shes just got a reputation and its easier to live up to it then it is to change it
@SlyJabroni Tell me if you spot the always hideous permed mullet
@KitxKatxKai It pisses me off because she isnt and Id know People suck boo
@KitxKatxKai She heard enough of it but I think shes kinda used to the slut jokes at this point boo
@KitxKatxKai Exactly It was completely justified boo Im just pissed I didnt break anything
@KitxKatxKai He was saying some really horrible stuff about Santana Trust me if you heard what he was saying you wouldve helped
@KitxKatxKai Im not a fan of peaceful resistance to anything I dislocated a dudes jaw the other week boo 
@KitxKatxKai  Its not worth it boo I treat some people how they should be treated though
@KitxKatxKai Nah Just people in general Itd be funny if it wasnt kinda annoying boo
@KitxKatxKai People act weird when Im not a dick
@KitxKatxKai I am I think Im annoying when Im not being a dick
@KitxKatxKai She loves me because I dont even know boo But I am pretty fun sometimes
@KitxKatxKai Now you sound like me boo I say that to Santana on a daily basis
@KitxKatxKai You make me smile too Except when you refuse to listen boo
@KitxKatxKai I was serious And boo apparently great minds think a like
@KitxKatxKai Telling me not to worry is like telling Kurt to not be gay boo Aint gonna work
@KitxKatxKai You know you can always talk to me right I just worry boo
@KitxKatxKai Babe no Are you talking to someone about this
@KitxKatxKai Im glad boo I dont like you being sad

@iamkurthummel That sounds vaguely dirty Hummel

EVEN THE ROAD IS ATTRACTED TO IT 
as well as the ability to manually shift gears for a more engaged driving experience
And its sixspeed transmission offers the driver exceptional performance at virtually any speed
Its 272horsepower V6 engine gives the ES a 060 time of 68 seconds 
 For those unfortunate times the ES offers performance technology thats up to the task

Is trying to figure this out
I love the sound of the doorbell ringing  the smiles on the faces as I open the door to a warm hug 
the music softly playing in the background the house decorated and the food set out  the drinks pouring
turkey roasing in the oven   the scented candles lit  mmmm
heres a little music to get you into the holiday spirit a little earlyone of my very favorites 
I know its early but
thatss what life is all about 
I love holidays and weekends anything to have a reason to get together with close friends and family
I feel loved and appreciated 
of my daughters are grown and moved out and count and depend on me to pull the family together and make it happen on the holidays
and they are 
only because I want my holidays to be special
and with the other things I see them at the store and think about throwing them in the cart but I dont
i wouldnt probably even like it if I had to eat it more than on thanksgiving but I look forward to it just because of that
same with the green bean caserole and pumpkin pie and cranberry sauce
But its one of those things that they will rememberthat mom used to buy only on the holidays
I love hawaian bread but I only buy it on the holidaysnot that its expensive or so special
so funny some disheds I dont eath throughout the year just so that they can be special on the holidays
But then the new year comes and I get all perked up again
it makes me realize that another year has gone by
It is almost time to put up the tree  
good company is so important  it can make a bad situation good

@frugalgirl no sugar in an orange is dif from sugar in chocolatemilk but I rather have some nutrients w milk rather than soda in schools
@lwcavallucci I totally agree with the inactivity part 2 many kids on the computer game console or watching TVthis is why kids are obese
It appears that some peopel really have a problem with chocolatemilk I hardly think this is what is making families obese
@JessicaGottlieb I didnt say EVERY day BTW my child is toddler and needs milk everyday still choclolatemilk is a treat once in awhile
@JessicaGottlieb Child is far from obese  I dont see anyting wrong with a class of low fat chocolate milk once a day chocolatemilk
I much rather my child drinks chocolate milk over soda or even sports drinks that are in schools Chocolatemilk

@snorwood13 I find audacity works best with a dedicated external mic and not the internal mic
@snorwood13 clarification audacity runs from your laptop Great freeware and easy conversion to mp3 for blogs email etc
@snorwood13 If youve got a mic you can run the free audacity program and record comments Just have the audience speak clearly and loudly

@MarissaAlwin Also what did the Halloween costume end up being Mauras going to be a purple and pink cat
@MarissaAlwin Cats love those clings Our Charlie kidnapped a green spider Also thanks for the well wishes Hey at least were early
Its a breezy cold gray day Earlier Basil and I played catch in the back yard for awhile but now I would like to sleep for many hours
Heh Maura in reference to her medicine My forehead is really hot I think I need another 28 milligrams
Big M has a chest infection will probably have swine flu in a day or two Poor family

@MarissaAlwin Its still just the cats and me by day Since I get all 8 of them during my workday M gets to take Basil to work
His name btw is Basil
Right now hes lying by the bed lazily watching Charlie cat who is lazily watching him back and trying to stealthily steal his food
Our poundfound hound is doing fine his first night home He likes the cats who are weirded out but curious and has been so good
Tonight when my wife announced that Im balding my daughter piped up Guess hell have to move
kitties playing by my desk wrestle lick bite lick lick lick bite bite
Though we live very close to several churches I dont regularly hear their bells Right now though their song is haunting and pretty
Tonight my daughter wrote in her dire diary
@DeeEdit Its because you live in the  deep southwest funny lady
@meghanmconrad Aww best Im sorry You made the house smell delicious though
@DeeEdit Woo Hope @GrammarGirl was awesome Not that I have any doubts
@DeeEdit Thats so odd Whats the cause of the battery death

@grrrlshapedyarn Happy wedding happy marriage Continue to enjoy your lives together Love to you both
Now off to drink beer  make beer brats
 shopping for cat litter caulk  ye childes bday Shes with her grandfolks So lonely but busy
Ive been alone all week because @meghanmconrad is at RomantiCon Been pretty productive so far puttering around the yard
Maura is in bed sobbing like her heart is leaving her because I miss being a littler kid
@bouree Oh its just workrelated frustration that has mostly passed Thanks though
@CoffeeNate Clearly I have not had coffee yet
The best thing that has happened to me today is a banana Do with that what you will
am and I have a horrible neckache and much rage
@TheOBR I agree Brady needs a long look Its going to be hard for him or any QB without playmakers at the skill spots
@TheOBR Marino is rightDA can do more with less Brady needs everything right around him
The Browns have 2 out of their 3 2nd round picks on the inactive list today With the two LBs on IR they could have used Malaluga
Did Brian Robiskie steal somebodys lunchthey wont throw to him and now hes inactive again
No Doubt RT @TheOBR Theres no shortage of headscratchers on that particular inactive list Wow
@MoveTheSticks Just watched a play were suh was blocked by 3 guys and still blocked the passWOW
Ya think RT @AdamSchefter Notre Dames Senior Day turned into a very bad day
@MoveTheSticks Who would u take with the 1st pick if the draft was today
@TheOBR Does this game speed up the process on the football czar
@richeisen Rich can u get the network out of the Browns game Put it on PBS
@richeisen Its good for the Steelersthey get healthy on the Browns
LOL RT @CoraxSays @ClevelandHuddle On Behalf Of Browns Nation I Apologize To The World For Having 2 Watch This Crap on National TV
The Ravens are playing 10 yards off on Robiskiethrow him the ball
They have to let Brady Quinn cut it loose
@richeisen Rich the truth hurtsbut they MNF guys are right
The guys in the MNF booth just broke it downBrowns are missing playmakers RT @CoraxSays @ClevelandHuddle WTF
Shaun Rodgers blocks the extra point up 130
Ravens get a pick six on a tipped pass
Time for the game to get out of hand
It would help if the Browns D had 11 guys instead of 10 on the field to stop Ray Rice from scoring a TD
Did Brandon Mcdonald just get burnt again
@CoraxSays They better come to play in the second half
Not a good omen to start 3 and out for the Browns offense
The key to this game will be what the Browns Offense can do with getting the ball first coming out of half time
0 at the half is good for the Brownies
@TheOBR Nice job with the facebooktwitter integration
@SIPeterKing I would like to write about Carson Palmers fear of an on field death in relation to current injuries and the 18 game schedule
 @RevRunWisdom Rev Runs words of wisdom is in paper back now pic it up ull enjoy it
@SIPeterKing Im ready for mmqb
@TheOBR We play the Bears again
 @QBKILLA Bengals Are For REAL Will you and Marshall be eating crow next week on NFLTA
My two favorite teams the Browns and anybody who beats the Steelers
 @MoveTheSticks Stage is set for Big Ben He excels in this stuffNot today
WOW the Bengals are 4 Real Down goes BenDown goes Ben on 4th down game over
@CoraxSays USC got straight beat downcould be what happens to the Browns tomorrow
Braylon Edwards has not caught a pass yet todayCome on BE Browns need 55
 @mortreport Polamalu doubtful to return this is very bad news for Steelers CBS Just said he is out for the gameUh Oh
 @MoveTheSticks I think Braylon is set up to have a huge 2nd half of the season starting with today Like 55 catches for 2nd pick
 @RevRunWisdom The problem with haters is Theyre hateful instead of grateful real talk
 @TheOBR Josh Cribbs  Class Let there be no doubt  The Browns just need 52 other guys like him

Forget mistakes Forget failure Forget everything except what youre going to do now and do it Today is your lucky day Will Durant

I had rather attempt something great and fail than to attempt nothing at all and succeed Robert Schuller
Your level of success is directly related to the level of people you surround yourself with 
People dont do things to you They do things for themselves
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it Henry David Thoreau
Unless you walk out into the unknown the odds of making a difference in your life are pretty low
The chief cause of failure and unhappiness in life is trading what you truly want for what you can have at the moment
Great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together
When you have the enthusiasm and the passion you end up figuring out how to excel Deena Kastor
The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind
Your level of success is directly related to the level of people you surround yourself with 
Dont wait The time will never be just right Napoleon Hill

If you do your research like Ive done and an opportunity seems too good to be true dont pass it up 
A positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
A professional is someone who can do his best work when he doesnt feel like it Alistair Cooke
Sometimes we stare so long at a door thats closing that we see too late the one thats open Alexander Graham Bell 
The first step in the acquisition of wisdom is silence the second listen
We will either find a way or make one

SEO Tip of the week Sign up for THIS if you dont want your competition to pass you by in social media 
Thanks  too @jaymiletsky and @lauralake   I enjoy a good debate
@lauralake just sayin its not always about who has the most friends online I have a reason for keeping certain communities  exclusive
@lauralake  my site is a PR4 not that PageRank matters much but just to give you an idea
@lauralake  with the emergence of social media social networking sites became the top 5 referring sites to our domain
@lauralake  My organic results are great 1st page ranking for numerous keywords
@jaymiletsky Yep  too many SEO clients makes for a poor service
@jaymiletsky Great point Marketing for an SEO firm is a different strategy than marketing for certain BtoCs for example Difft targets
@lauralake I think a small agency that has been in business over 12 years is proof that we DO know how to market ourselves
@lauralake I market myself quite well And I bring great success to clients Thats why Ive been doing this over 10 years
@lauralake If my clients want to know how good I am I share case studies with similar strategies to prove worth not something irrelevant
@lauralake @jaymiletsky Theres no cookie cutter approach to social SEO etc You have to consider your goals and market too
@lauralake I tend to agree with @jaymiletsky  Its not always a numbers game or a popularity contest either

In the USA  more toilets flush at the half time of the Super Bowl than at any other time of the year
The faucet handle in most bathrooms at work have 400 times more germs than the toilet seat
What do you think has more bacteria on it a toilet seat or a cell phone Let me ask you another questionhow often do you clean your phone
Urine on the toilet seat Although disgusting it is a nearly sterile liquid
The first toilet ever seen on television was on Leave It To Beaver
In the USA  more toilets flush at the half time of the Super Bowl than at any other time of the year
Did you know people name their toilets I have heard of naming cars boats kids but a toilet Let me knowwhat would you name your potty
 of all Americans feel better about themselves when they flush a toilet Silly is it not I guess that is a way to be a good American
6 billion people worldwide dont have access to toilet facilities Lack of suitable toilets and sanitation kills 18 million per year
Did you know there are round and elongated toilet seats Most public bathrooms have elongated Start observing the pottyWhat will you find
Want another way to potty train Try something that will make your youngster feel like a big boy or girl A toilet training toilet tattoo
The average person uses about 6 gallons of drinkable water per day for flushing the toilet
The average person visits the toilet 2500 times a year  about six to eight times a day Why not decorate the throne you sit on
And a total random and useless fact most toilets flush in the key of E flat
The first toilet cubicle in a public washroom is the least likely to be used it is also the cleanest That is a great potty fact to know
People know what they like and they decorate according to that But what if you were given the option to decorate and change it in a whim
The visitors at Yellowstone Park create 270 million gallons of waste per year and use up to 18 rolls of toilet paper per toilet per day
Who wants to be innovative Wrap that crapper with a Toilet Tattoo wwwtoilettattooscom
Ever think your powder room needs a makeover Try a toilet tattoo  wwwtoilettattooscom
Eww the potty training mini toilets There has to be another way Give your kids a reason to use the big people pottyToilet Tattoos
Lets propose a challengeGo into the bathroom if you think the toilet lid needs personality let us know what design you would like to see
Want to dress your toilet lid  up with a Christmas design  Or want something classical a flower or even your own customized Toilet Tattoo
Did you know that the average household has  three toilets Why not give the lid  a little flair and personality with  a Toilet Tattoos
Are you someone who decorates and after a few months wants to redesign For all the people who love change try a removable toilet tattoo
Have you ever thought what is festering in that fuzzy toilet seat rug on your lid Yuck We have the economical solution
Who would have thought you can dress up a toilet  Well you can simply with a removable reusable hygienic applique for the toilet lid

Setting goals to have an incredible final 4 months
wishing  i was where mari is  Jasper National park
I should say trying to first figure out the editing software
editing audio for my first information product
Switched blog themes  Messed up the code in the old one and decided to cut losses
watching the new season of Eureka
Mari just tweeted wowza and heaps of strategies  they both sounded more genuine  Im glad Im realizing I need to be creative
I mean we write copy using proven power words and phrases but have exploding or skyrocketing your sales become trite
Im writing some copy and was thinking When do cliches lose their impact
Hopefully finishing up my blog design and will have all the categories figured out by tonight  This took forever to birth
When you can truly communicate a passion to help others and your willingness to work for their success your success will follow
Celebrating a new client  today was a great day
thanks for the welcome Daniel  I can see myself needing a bit of help
I often hear them say I dont want to be pushy  If your product has value and benefits the client you owe it to them to offer it
I ask clients what type of sales training theyve had  Usually none  learn certain basics and watch profits grow dramatically
I just made a presentation to a business owner whos staff doesnt upsell  Theres big profits from just adding another product to a sale
Just downloaded piclens  exceptionally cool free browser plugin  well worth checking out  piclenscom
When I leave a store I ask myself Do they really want my business  If so why  didnt they get my name and give me a reason to return
Celebrating my wifes and the love of my life birthday  Also creating a PURL web campaign for a client
working on the new blog named it small business marketing guide  Itll be a free marketing resource

They moved an atheist billboard in Cincy because of all the death threats the buildings owner was getting  That is Christlike behavior
Whatever happened to Fred from Roseanne  That guy was alright
In downtown Cincy on Main St there is a store that sells only scooters and wait for itcoffins  They should call it WheeeAwwww
Just watched part of Nothing But Trouble on tv  Bizarre but not in an interesting way

If voting actually changed anything theyd make it illegal  Welcome to the same old shit everybody
@DrGonzoEsq can we get together and have a Nightcrawler  Wait no vahovries  Shucks
At the hospital with the wife for an ultrasound Hopefully the little guys horns will be coming in nicely at this point
Getting antsy about the Bengals game Sunday
@DrGonzoEsq Bedbugs carry lice  At least thats what I heard
@DrGonzoEsq you WOULD do something like that  I hope your office gets the bedbugs
I hate legal aid Their attorneys have nothing but free time on their hands to file ridiculous crap and their clients dont have money
I need a big day out of Austin from Dallas or my sports gambling days are numbered
@OutlawMoFo you mods are bullies man
Happy Halloween Rogan peeps and the rest of you  Stay clear of child predator patrols while youre out looking  for action tonight

I hate when a cute girl bums a cigarette while on her phone The price of a cigarette is your conversation dammit
I tried but I couldnt help but doze during the lecture on operating systems
@TriXTroll IT Architecture Java next
@TheMarkening Yeah I apparently need to be home right after class to watch Kar for a few hours
This class is considerably emptier than it used to be I guess learning about computer parts is too challenging for many people
Its almost class time after which I will hopefully find a suitable adventure Id like to set something on fire
@TheMarkening Im out of class at 4 and am definitely down for an afternoon adventure Any ideas
Live on Qik check it out

  Now that sounds like my kind of party I call the mom first
@kristigail It is a good solution I have used it several times with total success
@CKfighter Too expensive Its not even worth buying a beer
Dont worry @0x18fc1529 @trixtroll @sn0t i got word that later in the day he powered it off and back on and it started working again
Most human minds stunted by outmoded fictional accounts created by our dumbass ancestors before we knew calculus What could be more evil
This sense of inexplicable grownup mystery then stays with them as their only source of wonder denying them the vast universe science knows
Even small children know that doesnt make any sense but soon they accept that some grownup mystery explains contradictions in causality
I mean it says in YOUR book that God as his own son is pissed at his timetraveling fatherself for allowingintending him to be crucified
Hey If Jesus said Why did you forsake me to God then um How could he also be God That makes no sense guys Come on now
Selfdom is not a twoway street Time only moves one direction We forget that we did not know the final outcome when we made a decision
Balancing on the edge of a knife Like tightrope walking but much more blood
 @sarahrosehurt @futuredirected I blew mine missing a pedal on my brothers bicycle How sexy is that  extremely sexy
Reckoning is just a fancy word for guessing But I reckon my estimation rather awkwardly
Fortitude does not reflect the same survivability constraints that used to render its value structure
Although you may deny this rancid anathema is relevant I emphasize that your periodic sentiments prescribe the framework of interpretation
Your enemies may discern emotions such as fear and surprise so weve prepared botox treatments to ensure you give nothing away
Now where did I leave that hatchet grumbles Nothing worse than an inadequate blunt object at a time like this
Somehow youre still alive Congratulations Youve made it to the final elimination You will be eliminated Finally Terminated perhaps
Its not the way you look its the way you hook Bitch youd better get me that money
  And finally stubbing it out
  Ashing
  I heart smoking
  Light it up sucka
  Footrest is a box of books Air conditioner blows the fuse
Sometimes I can hear the blood rushing and other times I hear an empty stomach gurgling almost silently in my skull What do you hear
@Senshuu Super Mario World cures all ailments
  My statue of jesus in its place of veneration I am ironically very attached to it
These demons be wilier than I expected but nonetheless purpose will emerge Too much difficulty selecting nowadays Wherefore art thou
  Me and a shield That is all
Any of you twitches want to step up your game IRL This weekend clearly indicates I need a larger social circle smokinalone

@MeanMartini I have no idea I will try to find out tomorrow Cincinnati artist I believe
I wish that last one was a joke But I actually dont have much cartilage in my body Scheuermanns disease so Im told

  This painting lives in our garage Its so creepy I love it
Serfdom its like surfing but with more of a monarch fucking your wife and less ocean
@lovestoned420 I wish I knew girls as cute and funny as you who didnt only live in my phone
Well I guess Ill smoke a bowl and think of a way to be entertained until I fall asleep
 @MrsGushy Ok fine im dressd in a dayum gorilla costume swingn from tha fan cum get it lmao  hot
Sitting at home alone The elves dwarves and mages are all pledged to help me in Dragon Age now So at least I accomplished something
@princesskd1 Word Cincy is boring tonight
@futuredirected I got stood up too triflinasshoes
@futuredirected Aww i wouldnt stand you up D
Just woke up from a nice nap The chair fell backwards and I just stayed there dozing
@MrsGushy Nothin at all Its a little boring
I am getting bored and sleepy Cincinnati Damn you
@MrsGushy Hehe theres always gettin crunked Im bored Why aint Cincinnati poppin
@Uncucumbered Hahaha I bet none Maybe as many as two depending on cancer types
@sweetlibertine Very exciting So its a party Hmm
@NicoleStier Oh certainly Just pointing out that sometimes people get better regardless of treatment Not often of course
 @sarahrosehurt RT @Uncucumbered RT @NicoleStier well the cancer survival rate for ppl without insurance is 0 asshole  some survive
@sweetlibertine Thats wild PS you know youre on your work account yes
@sweetlibertine Er Im good Or is there entertainment worth seeing
@sallybanner Awesome that sounds perfect Heh
Also secret Nazis dont really do it for me @sn0t
@sallybanner Ha where you at Im free
When crazy people start screaming about Jews and the media and how Palin is smart do I care if they unfollow I guess @sn0t
There are more human life stories occurring at this moment than in all of recorded history I dig it
@sallybanner You win a prize for that answer Shall I smoke you out XD
@sn0t I would never react all crazy like that whether you criticized Obama Christopher Hitchens or even me Youd better check yo self
Notions in oceans of heads that keep thrumming The combined computational power of humans today is greater than in all of history combined
In an evolutionary sense ideas that survive best are those with the greatest salience not necessarily the best ideas
Its the impotent who blame others for the failure of their own message Understand humans as dynamic agents and such illusions disappear
Anytime I hear the phrase Jew media I think of the Klan Dont you Theyre the ones who support ideas like that
@sn0t And that jew media shit doesnt fly with me People with money control the media But that phrase reeks of antisemitism and racism
@sn0t Im against taxes too kneejerk I just dont trust Palin any more than I trusted Bush Republicans lie Democrats cry As usual
@sn0t Shit you know Im a libertarian and I dont support democrats either but youre acting like a psycho bitch Whats the deal
 @sn0t fuck you and your race card Cant speak openly then piss off in a world that is open no color Kiss mine Jerk  incoherent
@sn0t You are reacting just like a crazy batshit conservative No listening no room for error in your beliefs just acting fucking crazy
@sn0t Have you not figured out the repubs game They pretend to be antigovernment until theyre in office Then they expand govt powers
@sn0t She states plain and simple republican antitax ideas just like bush but would do the same he did  warmonger increase government
@sn0t Personality Shes about as interesting as a soccer mom and she even claims to be one Shes antiintellectual and superficial
 @sn0t @invisibleh Shes fighting the jew media Hard to do but she has to for freedom  thats straight racist dude And scary
I cant decide if I want to read or play video games Can I play a book or read a video game No Dammit

@VanetaRogers Okay but theres a distinct difference between overcoming fear and causing it 
@GailSimone If I read the Fox News scripts correctly Friday was designated Obama Is Judas Iscariot Day  Hope this helps 
@VanetaRogers While there are defensive idiots like Nancy Pelosi claiming racism most of the fear is being fueled by rightwing propoganda
@VanetaRogers Fox News and talk radio barrage their audiences with opinions of how Obama is destroying the country hates America etc
@VanetaRogers to the point where people genuinely become afraid and we get things like this  
@JamesDRobinson Hope you enjoyed The Girl in the Fireplace  Its become my alltime favorite DOCTOR WHO episode
@VanetaRogers As a former Republican Im all for smaller government but I also recognize there are areas where it serves a purpose
@VanetaRogers And theres certainly nothing wrong about questioning the government but opposition among party lines accomplishes nothing
@VanetaRogers And yesthe economy should be the 1 issue so why is there so much focus on where Obama was born or indoctrination of kids
@VanetaRogers And why arent we talking about things like how the Dow has climbed back up from 6500 to 9800 since February
has decided it should be Talk Like A Pittsburgh Pirate Day instead
Somalian Pirates We OFFICIAL SOUTH PARK SONG 
@VanetaRogers Well a good portion of the time his opposition IS misinformed as five minutes on independent site FactCheckorg proves
@VanetaRogers Without knowing your specific problems or exactly where youre getting your info I cant tell if youre as informed or not
@VanetaRogers but since FactCheckorg calls out both parties inaccuracies its a solid resource for finding real truth instead of spin
@VanetaRogers Its certainly more credible than most media outlets these days or any biased news site like Drudge Report or Huffington Post
was pleasantly surprised that his wife brought home a small box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts today  I guess Ill keep her for another week
@IreneAdler But if I hold on to my wife with BOTH hands then how can I hold on to a doughnut  Think big picture Irene

Facing Racism
Limbaugh doesnt ask questions for answers
Limbaugh asks questions to hear the reverberations of His voice echoing back
Limbaugh cant learn anything because he wont accept anything he thinks he doesnt  know
Getting serious about a serious subject in Americaits stain of Racism
Just speaking as a citizen of America who desires for America to stand United
When America begins 2 ask a person like myself 4  answers about Racism in America then America will begin to overcome its problem of racism
Mr Jimmy Carter can speak clearly from a perspective of some1 like himselfI can speak clearly for someone like myselfits only practical
Not listening to those affected by the disease is pure foolishness
Wondering if any1 is really listening 2 meI and people like me have answers  Not listening to us is why we still have racism in America

Correction the call is a chop block
BG is driving now at the Marshall 21yard line
Marshall takes their first timeout of the second half
Phillips makes his first kick of the game BG trails 1710
Darius Marshall returns the kick off to the 46yard line BG has two timeouts remaining
BG takes a timeout one remaining 228 left in the contest Marshall at midfield with a 3rd and five
BG gets the stop and take the timeout Marshall will punt with 222 remaining
BG will take over at own 16 the Falcons have 213 to go 84 yards
Hodges with the nice catch for a 20yard gain
Big third down for the Falcons
Barnes makes his 16th catch of the night setting the school record for receptions in a game
Booth is challenging if Sheehan was in throwing motion or not
It was an incompletion and BG will have a 3rd and 10
Chris Wright makes a big first down reception
Barnes with his 17th catch of the evening for a first down
6 seconds remain BG at the Marshall 15yard line
Big sack for Marshall as they drag Sheehan back to the 26 yard line its now 3rd and 21
th and 21 for the Falcons this play will decide the game most likely 306 second remain
And Barnes drops the would be first down to end the drive
And it goes final 1710

Just landed in rainy Nashville Good day to be inside for a hockey game CBJ
Teams have taken the ice at Sommet Center Mathieu Garon in net for CBJ and Pekka Rinne in net for Nashville
Umberger is wearing the C while Commodore and Vermette each have an A
Just 634 into the game and the game is scoreless Nashville leads 31 in shots
Midway through the first and its still scoreless Shots 61 in favor of the Preds CBJ
To listen to tonights game live on the internet click  CBJ
CBJ RW Derek Dorsett called for delay of game at 1124 Predators to the power play
With 542 to go in the first still scoreless
Grant NSH 2minutes kneeing and unsportsmanlike conduct Blunden CBJ 2minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct CBJ to the power play
CBJ LW Tom Sestito injured in a first period fight He was assisted off the ice by teammates
Sestito is coherent but has been taken to a local hospital for more evaluation
Despite being outshot 135 the Blue Jackets strike first when Andrew Murray buries a rebound off a Derek Dorsett shot at 613 of the 2nd
CBJ takes a 20 lead after Vermette takes a loose puck from in front of the net and buries it at 1216 of the second
NSH G Pekka Rinne has been replaced by Dan Ellis
Mathieu Roy and Mike Commodore get the assists on Vermettes goal
A change on the scoring for the CBJ second goal Vermette from Roy and John Moore
NSH cuts the CBJ lead in half when Ryan Jones takes a feed from Tootoo and fires it past Garon 21 with 152 to go in the second
CBJ Nikita Filatov to the box for hooking at 1940 of the second NSH to the PP
CBJ still leads with 1424 to go in the third
Dan LaCosta now in goal for CBJ

 Its just one of the 20 Actively Safe features offered on the RX
These features were inspired by our belief that the safest accident is the one that never happens 
Of course if impact does occur you can also take comfort in knowing that the RX features a host of passive safety measures as well
 Like a classleading 10airbag system and active front headrests   
These headrests can move upward and forward in the event of a certain types of rear collisions to help prevent whiplash
After all while there are countless differences between the allnew RX and the previous generation
the one thing that will never change is the priority that we place on safety

Pryor throws one up for grabs for late interception but OSU ahead 140 on Toledo thru 1
Dan Herrons 4yard run puts OSU ahead of overmatched Toledo 210 early in 2nd qtr
No 11 Ohio State cruising past defensechallenged Toledo 310 through 3 qtrs

Any thoughts on how far USC drops from No 3 this week Do I hear five spots Six
If Canes beat VaTech next week they deserve to be in the Top 10 And shouldnt Jacory Harris be top 3 in Heisman race

Story on OSUToledo 
Bearcatty about Cincinnati Dont be surprised if UC is unbeaten heading into November
Ohio State drops from 11th to 13th in AP Top 25 Good thing Buckeyes didnt beat Toledo worse than 380 Mite b out of pollcompletely
And the answer is  Nine spots USC freefalls to 12th with another disappointing loss to a Pac10 alsoran
Bengals just had a penalty called according to the ref on the whole offensive line
And Ochocinco just made the Lambeau Leap after catching a TD pass
Dont look now Buckeyes but UC Bearcats just one spot and 61 points behind after jumping three rungs in latest AP poll
