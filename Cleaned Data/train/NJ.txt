No time to stop though  Marching on  wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091026 024527Trenton NJ
I know this place It is Bear Tavern The owners are a friend of the family Maybe I should slip off to get warm  177620091026 024444Trenton NJ
Finally moving though we are a smaller group than who crossed Feet and legs in so much pain wwwtrotrymenssoulscom 177620091026 023036Trenton NJ
As dry as possible in this blinding snow and rain Word comes in moving out wwwtotrymemenssoulscom 177620091026 022755Trenton NJ
The storm is increasing in fury Clothes soaked again wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091026 014437Trenton NJ
Having difficulty standing Legs are swollen Leaning on Peter for support wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091026 010027Trenton NJ
I collect my clothes which were hung by the fire wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091026 003112Trenton NJ
I must make room for other freezing soaked men by the fire wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091026 001517Trenton NJ
Peter glares at me but is also relieved  wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 233009Trenton NJ
Out of wet clothes A blanket over me I am rotating around as close to the fire as I can stand trying to warm myself 177620091025 231511Trenton NJ
I am freezing and embarrassed They move me over by the fire and make me strip out of wet clothes wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 231028Trenton NJ
I am pulled up by strong arms It is one of the dock workers We move ashore as others pull the boat in wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 225916Trenton NJ
I am overwhelmed by the freezing water The cold is like daggers piercing into my lungs 177620091025 225734Trenton NJ
15 feet away from the dock 10 Suddenly I hit the end of the sand bar and lose my footing 177620091025 225604Trenton NJ
Icy river knee deep We are pulling the boat closer 20 feet wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 225508Trenton NJ
I volunteer Peter my friend calls me a fool but then follows me wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 225121Trenton NJ
Colonel Glover has asked for volunteers to get out lighten the load and pull the boat to the dock wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 225009Trenton NJ
Our boat is so overloaded that we are hitting bottom 25 yards away from the NJ shore wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 224537Trenton NJ
What an honor I am on the same boat as @GenWashington76 wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 223623Trenton NJ
Hard to breath but I think I can make it wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 214506Trenton NJ
Peter and I gather our supplies and leave wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 213509Trenton NJ
Im awoken with a start Time to move out wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 213022Trenton NJ
Finally drifting off to sleep despite the cold  Zzzz  Zzzzz Zzzzz  wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 194608Trenton NJ
Hard to breathe Think my fever is getting worse Will not be left behind wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 192022Trenton NJ
Instructed to try and get some rest Sleeping is hard in this cold harder still with my lungs on fire wwwtotrymenssoulscom 177620091025 184501Trenton NJ

@Connectionary you may be right but care will suffer as a result20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary Im saying as a result of insurance reform care will suffer Govt cant fix insurance or care tho Can only make it worse20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary No no Doing that will only increase costs Insurance measures risk Increase risk increase cost Wont work20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary The only thing the govt is responsible for is ensuring that legal contracts are upheld20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary No You insure against specific measurable risks Thats what insurance is20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary If I insure my house against fire its because I think theres a possibility my house could burn down20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary A free market is the only thing that can entice insurers to offer better deals and not screw customers20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary But govt has created an environment where that kind of behavior thrives20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary The insurance company doesnt insure anything the customer does20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary Entitlements such and medicaremedicaid have created the culture where ppl expect insurance to cover everything20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary Without them people would pay maintenance out of pocket and everything would be much cheaper20090917 070900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary Insurance companies simply try to make a profit by measuring risk as accurately as possible20090917 080900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary If they do a good job they take in more money in premiums than they pay out20090917 080900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary Agreed But those licensing laws and prescription laws etc is a great example of govt driving up cost20090917 080900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary Paid for by who They are subsidized heavily at the least20090917 080900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary The problem with health care is cost That high cost is directly caused by the govts ridiculous interventions in the market20090917 080900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary The only socially responsible thing the govt can do is stay out and let a free market work its magic20090917 080900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary It can only foster competition by getting out of the way Everything govt does to fix the problems inhibit competition20090917 080900Jersey City NJ
@Connectionary Its basic economics Price fixing doesnt work20090917 080900Jersey City NJ

@Cubachi True but last I knew Rush highly supports Sarah Palin  she has NEVER talked abt working w other side Talks abt what right 4 USA20090919 210900Edison NJ
@Cubachi GOP needs a lot of work  I think Rush knows this limited govt lower taxes NOT accepting lib agenda  premises hes said this20090919 210900Edison NJ
@Cubachi Rush is not  never has been carrying the GOP that is nonsense20090919 210900Edison NJ
@Cubachi Hes been as frustrated as the rest of us w their support of RINOs spending etc20090919 210900Edison NJ

@Cubachi And Rush typically has takes on things no one else does I like someone who makes me think not react emotionally20090919 210900Edison NJ
@Cubachi I agree and he doesnt need to get nasty about it either Just tells it like it is20090919 220900Edison NJ
@Cubachi He can be suggestive at times  warns pple ahead of time when parents may not want the kiddies listening depending on story but20090919 220900Edison NJ
@Cubachi Ive never heard him go for shock value ratings boosting its always substantive  appropriate20090919 220900Edison NJ
