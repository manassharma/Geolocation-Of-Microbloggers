@ariherzog I equate building social communities  as using social media and that moving them to action made them effective
@ariherzog They didnt use the ComcastMassGovernor approach of direct convos but I think they did lots to get ppl on MyBO YouTube etc
@ariherzog Is social media abt candidatetocitizen interactn or abt enabling users to interact or create content
@Bobbiec So when it is a tool for reaching masses like TV theyll know to put on their makeup or whatever best practices emerge
@Bobbiec There may be a learning curve but benefit of scial media is theyre testing the waters now while the audience is smaller unlike TV
@Bobbiec Wish I were there curious what you mean by unfair advantage

ADVICE 10 Ways To Build Trust with Social Media httpkylelacycom10waystobuildtrustwithsocialmedia
The goal is to change selfattachment to concern for others This is based on equilibrium thru meditation not physically LamaYeshe
It is a complete practice and it shows the heart of the instruction of the earlineage of Ganden Lama Zopa Rinpoche Buddhism
If you are able to do the practice of Guru Puja in your daily life it contains all the important points of sutra and tantra Lama Zopa
Whats practical is to check how everyday problems arise Thats the most important thing  thats what practicing dharma means LamaYeshe
As much as u can train your mind in bodhicitta  try to realise that attachment is the greatest obstacle to happiness of daily life LYeshe
Make Your mind an OceanLama Yeshe Buddhism
Bodhicitta requires intense wisdom its not based on emotional sorrow Lama Yeshe
Bodhicitta  the enlightened attitude that begins with seeing all sentient beings including u have the potential to attain enlightenmt LY
Buddhism emphasizes that your main saviour is yourself Neither God or Buddha is responsible for your ve  ve actions you are LamaYeshe
Somebody elses saying that youre good or bad doesnt make you good or bad Youre responsible Lama Yeshe
In order to benefit others we dont necessarily have to do anything physical we just have to turn our mind in that direction Lama Yeshe
We meditate to experience how our mind works not to change our ideas or try out some Eastern trip Lama Yeshe meditation
@el8edblu Indeed Slowly slowly itll get easier Youre doing great just trying 
Check out httptwitthiscomc89mnz
Just posted audio recordings and transcripts of Lama Zopa Rinpoche giving commentary during a Medicine Buddha puja buddhism
Physical exercise is good but mental exercise is better its more powerful Lama Yeshe meditation
When problems arise instead of turning away stare them right in the face Thats very useful thats the buddhist way Lama Yeshe
Mental energy coupled with right method and right wisdom is unlimited and always with you Lama Yeshe buddhism meditation
The human problem is not hunger or thirst its misconception and mental pollution Lama Yeshe buddhism
If you liked Lama Yeshes quotes you can find more in the book Becoming Your Own Therapist

Tony Dungy says on TV As much as you respect Peyton Manning you have to punt the ball Talking about 4th down call
Didnt get it They said the pass was being bobbled  one yard short The refs should be reviewing it right
Woah  are the Patriots going for it
Last time Peyton Manning was picked off twice in a game was on Nov 30 of last year
Wilhite Not sick anymore apparently  Looked like miscommunication with Manning and Wayne not on the same page  Big pick by Wilhite
Insanely huge play by center Dan Koppen He jumped on Bradys fumble retaining possession
Someone needs to guard Randy Moss I mean seriously 7 catches for 167 yards two TDs
Now THAT was some sick downfield blocking Welkers 69yard punt return into the red zone Good blocks by Sanders Lockett
It goes without saying that Maroney fumble in the end zone was just crushing Not that it wouldve put the game away but almost
Holy brain dead On Boddens pick Chung pretended to take a picture of Bodden who posed Drew a penalty and likely a tonguelashing

Edelman scores a TD and then  in an awesomely smart move  spikes the ball with his left noninjured arm 
Its Kaczur who got beat by Mathis for a sack But its a field goal and the Pats lead 
Isaiah Stanback makes a catch for a first down Wow
RapSheet Patriots and Colts are just like the field on fire httpbitlypx2g6
Tully has a rib injury Hes questionable That means Rob Ninkovich is in
Randy Moss can fly no news there Big 55yard catch
Where is Joseph Addai Looks like he sustained a finger injury His return is officially questioanable
Tully BantaCain down on the field surrrounded by trainers
After Joseph Addais touchdown there was streamers and fireworks on the field with embers landing on the 50yard line Weird
Ron Borges says unwise challenge Well see if the Patriots pay for it later but that was a key catch by Reggie Wayne
Stanback on punt return duty Kevin Faulk gets the start at RB
Patriots open in Nickel which well see a lot Burgess Wright Vince and BantaCain on line Chung is extra DB
 @mrs75 Hoping for a safe game on both sides From Vinces wife Bianca Good call
A fake streaker with Bradys 12 painted on his back and ran onto the field and was tackled by the Colts mascot A joke and mildy funny

Getting into my room then bed eventually Listening 2 the Ipod trying 2 just relax and think
Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing
I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth Yes I will praise Him among the multitude PSALM 
For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go I will guide you with My eye PSALM 
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
The ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away
Finally in bed Not feeling 2 good but Ill get through it Watching some One Tree Hill then going 2 BED
But his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night
Watched Fly Away Home Wow what a movie I cried  and Im man enough 2 admit it Taught me something that Ill never 4get
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
Getting into bed Relaxing and thinking while watching some One Tree Hill
Strength does not come from winning Your struggles develop your strength When you overcome hardships that is strength
Never lose faith no matter how challenging or hard life gets on you never lose hope of a better tomorrow
Haha One Tree Hill is hilarious tonight Best show on TV no questions asked
Anything is possible They can tell me that I have a 90 50 or a 1 percent chance but what they cant tell me is how much heart I have
People can say what they wanna say about me but most of em dont even know me so I wont let them get to me Ill just keep doing my thing
Lord by your favor you have my mountain stand strong you hid your face and I was troubled Psalm 
Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust and respecteth not the proud now such as turn aside to lies Psalm 
Have no fear your with God
No matter how  many distractions are faced on you stay focused
Mmmm whatchya say is a song dumb
Mmmm whatchya say
Place If I  quit however it lasts forever Lance Armstrong
Pain is temporary It may last a  minute or an hour or a day or a year but eventually it will subside and something  else will take its
On my way home from practice About 2 chow down sike Thats whats my mom does like its her job
Through thee will we push down our enemies though thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us Psalm 
No joke
I dont care You guys over there live like bears Haha got em
No question
Hey lil sis that I DONT miss haha got em
Watching some One Tree Hill
I dont care what they say about me cuzz I know ME better than any1 ever will and thats a fact you just spread rumors and assume
This is 4 you I dont care what they say about me Imma do it 4 you
Getting into bed One Tree Hill is easily the best show on TV no1 even near it Listening 2 the Ipod Who knew songs had so much meaning
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back 2 being a kid 2 much pressure now and not as much fun anymore One Tree Hill coming up soon
Guide me in your truth and teach me for you are God my Savior and my hope is in you all day long Psalm 
Laying down in bed Good time 2 relax and think Watching One Tree Hill as well
I will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou Lord only makest me dwell in safety Bible Psalm 
And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God to those who are called according to His purpose ROMANS

An ordinary person is either a fox or a hedgehog appreciating only the big picture or the details of the moment A spiritual person is both
Mosaic Tiles of carnelian lapis jade Muralist sets picture 1 centimeter at a time Every piece is precious Together a priceless whole
POC Day 304 I will support a National Social Business Program that will inject 1 trillion of federal stimulus into the nonprofit sector
I is interface between Higher Self and lower self The Higher Self transmits spirit into the lower self When we sleep we cultivate energy
When you act spiritually you give birth to the spirit that was inside you This living spirit grows up inside someone else as inspiration
Supporting energy for spiritual action is a womb nurturing your glowing life force Your body is the womb for the life force of your essence
Each moment is an opportunity to match your spiritual energy with someones needs Corresponding energy provides a framework Music and love
Spiritual action motivates recycled action reaction which is inspiration Your essence replicates  innovates as a living spiritual force
Good action is the foundation of wisdom because it translates spiritual energy inside you into the world outside you for everyone to witness
Spirituality is when you receive a vision sent by the Higher Self Youre wise when you act on it You have wisdom when you act consistently
We need a new spiritual language that isnt strictly materialistic but grounded in reality Produce a global consciousness with Social Media
Religion no longer central to our affairs because of mass education Weve reverted to individual spiritual identities Religion is archaic
Religion and language use organizing systems Grammar rituals Early use of language was religious texts that communicated spirit to masses
Spirituality occurs in pure form when I receive messages from Spirit but only I understand and use them Religion makes spirituality global
Rhythmic pounding of bloodless glee enraptures glorious thought birthing divine energy in wake of wise action Gratify your spiritual thirst
Spirit is pure action Intuitive thought synthesized with intense emotion to create synergy that powers your physical body Thrive in light
Intensity Spirit is strangely colorless Yet intense It grips like a tidal wave Engage ecstatic bliss that flows with divine awareness
POC Day 303 I will encourage the Republican Party to nominate Sarah Palin for President in 2012 so they will experience the Democrats 
We must create a planetary consciousness that is peaceful creative inspirational and filled with wisdom Start by using Social Media well
Spiritual people build bridges for humanity to enter the kingdom of heaven by helping everyone create Heaven on Earth starting with thought
A spiritually mature person inspires others in both the private sphere and public sphere so they experience divine collective consciousness
A spiritually immature person develops a rich inner life or a rich outer life Family and professional activities A mature person has both
Every moment you spend out of the public spotlight is a moment that you should spend enhancing your spiritual maturity and creative ability
Susan Boyle got famous fast from just 5 songs because she cultivated her depth pure voice and spiritual power over a lifetime of obscurity
Blinding sepulchre thrashing metamorphosis glomming onto delirium of creative destruction producing radical shift in consciousness evermore
A big wheel of life is harder to start because of its size A small wheel is easier to start but requires more effort to cover same distance
People with big wheels of life are unproductive say 1 book or album every 5 years but every product is a significant  profound creation
People with small wheels of life are very productive but their most significant and profound creations come after 100s of mediocre attempts
Bracing camphora infuses ecstasy in rapturous awakening capturing senescence in idle plains of soul Quickened heart implodes majestically
The farther your talent and mental components reach out into the world the bigger your wheel of life is A big wheel will take you very far
The wheel of life consists of your public activities your private thoughts and the spiritual center in you that radiates out to support it
Ambition career and daily activity are public faces we show depending on the context Our talents and spiritual philosophies support them
You know youre living spiritually when you stop focusing solely on accomplishment  start focusing on connecting your work with your ideals
You know that you are living spiritually when you make sure your clothes reflect the beauty inside you instead of letting fashion define you

@bpiphus This is me looking out my living room window Its my back yard
Jesus  Buddha were at most fundamental level great teachers They sparked a quest for wisdom in their followers All teachers must do this
Teaching is the ultimate spiritual crusade Demonstrate Spiritual Arbitrage Show students how to replicate the positive reinforcement cycle
Spiritual teachers first prove competence in the classroom then spiritually empower their students so they can thrive outside the classroom

A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty

When God shuts one door He opens another
Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises httpwwwmaximizingsuccesscom
Opportunities They are all around usthere is power lying latent everywhere waiting for the observant eye to discover it
Spend eighty percent of your time focusing on the opportunities of tomorrow rather than the problems of yesterday
There is only one success  to spend your life in your own way
Whoever is happy will make others happy too He who has courage and faith will never perish in misery

Have faith in God God has faith in you
Knowledge comes but wisdom lingers
The man who has done his best is a success even though the world may write him down as a failure
Success is simply a matter of luck Ask any failure
Success in all fields depends more on energy and drive than it does on intelligence This explains why we have so many stupid leaders
Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm
In order to succeed you must fail so that you know what not to do the next time
Failure is success if we learn from it
What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us

What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters
Success is always temporary When all is said and done the only thing youll have left is your character
After Im dead Id rather have people ask why I have no monument than why I have one
Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking
The quality of a persons life is in direct proportion to his  her commitment to excellence regardless of his or chosen field of endeavor
You cant measure the heart of a champion
Character is a diamond that scratches every other stone
A person shows what he is by what he does with what he has
Do right Do your best Treat others as you want to be treated
That which does not kill me makes me stronger
Circumstances do not make a man they reveal him Dr Wayne W Dyer
Always do right  this will gratify some and astonish the rest Mark Twain
The Future is so Bright That I have to Wear Sunglasses
He who does not thank for little will not thank for much Estonian Proverb
There is no greater difference between people than between grateful and ungrateful people
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures Thornton Wilder
Not what we say about our blessings but how we use them is the true measure of our thanksgiving  WT Purkiser
Gratitude is the best attitude
He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not but rejoices for those which he has Epictetus
If you count all your assets you always show a profit
Praise the bridge that carried you over
Grace isnt a little prayer you chant before receiving a meal  Its a way to live
The only people with whom you should try to get even with are those who have helped you
If the only prayer you said in your whole life was thank you that would suffice Meister Eckhart
God gave you a gift of 86400 seconds today  Have you used one to say thank you William A Ward
Many of our prayers were not answered and for this we are now grateful
Nothing is more honorable than a grateful heart
You gain power by pretending to be weak By contrast you make people feel strong You save people by letting them save you
Talent is God given Be humble Fame is mangiven Be grateful Conceit is selfgiven Be careful
When you are grateful fear disappears and abundance appears

@chewtonic @TraderFlorida I agree that vol isnt super heavy but relative 2 the past 7 days its heavier Im curious to see the final num
One good sign is that the ENTIRE world is buying UUP 23 calls for NovDec which makes me think the dollar wont rally much IMHO 
The market rose the past 7 days on light volume and is selling off today on heavy volume not a good sign 
@cpruette I dont currently own any Brazil names but my watch list includes GFA ABV BAK GGB SID BVN Peru

Decent entry point for BVN here at 3870 support near 36 great Weekly chart 
Decent entry for FFIV here at 4805 support near its 20day at 4550 looks like it wants to go higher

I am still trying to wrap my head around Mad Men from last night Probably one of my favorite season finales ever
@mdurwin hopefully something productive will come of google wave but right now it doesnt look hopeful
@ArieRich the basic 895 package per month
@neenerspb do you want me to finally watch BSG or not
@JenKaneCo I am pretty excited about this

@Kingsteve httpwavegooglecom the easiest thing to call it is a collaboration platform
@dianafreedman over ten days I think I cant find the facebook thread where I got the invite from
@mdurwin I have about 15 friends on there on my contacts I am going to invite a few business partners and see what happens
I finally got my Google Wave invite I guess there goes the whole me getting work done for the next hour or so
I cant start my monday without reading Monday Morning QB It isnt posted yet I now realize I am a total creature of habit
@bigguyd oh I agree I wonder if most of us used it without the hype if we would have a different opinion
@bigguyd Did you have high expectations going in
@DirectCapital in your opinion do you think it will get there
@karikorkiakoski it was interesting that it was what everyone was talking about and then big decline
@prblog interesting I wonder what the adoption is going to be 6 months from now and a year from now
@mparks interesting I didnt really think of that
@launchgum @nigellegg was it a let down or were people building it up way too much before they saw it
Had dinner with @robmay last night Always good to see him and hear what Backupify is doing httpbitlyrQ0KE Check them out
Is it me or has the Google Wave talk and excitement kind of declined a bit
Just made dinner plans with @robmay tomorrow should be a good time
@ChrisAWheeler two birds with one stone
@ChrisAWheeler It is fun pointing out their half assed work and watching the client destroy them Better than tv
There is nothing better than helping a client that has a web design firm that does subpar work and misleads them Ugh
@tweric no problem I figured it was my good deed for the day I had about 25 of those spam messages hit at once
@twip2 ah I forgot about that one Yes I have zero idea who you are but the link you are posting could be me mustchecklink
@twip2 wait I shouldnt open a link that is going to give me a free IQ test because someone I dont know sent it to me
I love when you tell people that their account was hackedphished and they question you about it like you are lying to them Ugh
 @JasonFalls If you read anything today make it this httpbitly4DcDQK Thinkin about you a lot @CajunMama
@RobertDwyer it was an excellent show
It would be nice if twitter could just ban DMs of certain URLS that are spam or hacked accounts
@johnmccrory I heard that the morning presentations were really strong My style is not to make eye contact and talk to the floor 
@johnmccrory thanks John It was all 101 stuff that you without a doubt have a grasp on You probably didnt miss much
Did back to back presentations in NH for the Social Media Bootcamp I dont think I have talked that much in a 24 hour period ever
At NH social media bootcamp listening to @millennium rock it on coporate blogging
My friends company is doing a 20 person travel get away with a funny vacation photo contest httpbitly2mt2IW

@lorianrivers there has been hits and misses it goes in cycles
Im still recovering from how bad SNL was last night It actually kind of depressed me to watch it this morning
@QueenofSpain or they dont want to alienate a large portion of who follows them
@QueenofSpain lets say they have a neg opinion I think they dont take a position because they deal with companies that deal with MBs
@QueenofSpain I think experts dont touch the MB subject is because they have to cater to MBs but also MBs overvalue themselves way too much

@Ronaldbravo yeah there are without a doubt a lot of awful teams out there this year Cant wait for the Chiefs Raiders game Sunday ugh
@Ronaldbravo didnt hear anything about the broadcast but a 106 game with 5 ints doesnt look entertaining
@elliotschimel the sad thing is I probably would keep it on all day in the background when they are on I need to get out more
@DrRecruiter I was reading the recap of the game and super thankful I didnt spend time watching it
Last night made me really happy that I dont have the NFL network
WordPress 286 is out Another security update
@mhill oh I know the serve different purposes If you are using a fanpage as a replacement for a blog that is a pretty poor strategy
@ChadNorthrup interventions perhaps Really Do you really need your own page 7 people follow you on Twitter
@SaraLang But you can feel connected to them but not directly message them and have any content you post edited Sweet
@markbrian I was going to create one for my socks which have a hole in them
@SaraLang Im not calling people out Ive noticed a lot of social media people
@markbrian @Wzzy I get it if you are someone that has 5K friends and hit the limit but like 500 Really
If you have less than 500 friends on Facebook and then create a fan page to direct people to isnt that a bit egocentric
I am amazed at what people do with coupons like the grocery game from GMA a Mass family lives off 4wk httpbitly1PTzFA

@neenerspb what she wrote or what she told to someone to write I am sure things will blow up in her face even worse
@neenerspb I just watched the video why I felt like torturing myself
@kimmiekm there is a point where your 15 minutes are up and you just begin to milk it
@neenerspb that point of the debate is over it has moved onto her trying to milk it and make money and being taken down a peg or two
Sometimes it is okay to slink away from the public spotlight and just shut your trap Carrie Prejean and the Gosselins should take note

@aspen818 I agree
Russ trying to strike something up with Jessie There was a wink at the end of their whispering
@aspen818 They were talking about the pros and cons basically of keeping Russ over Jessie vice versa
@ebolacolas Yes you could be right I think they should keep Russ but they dont think so at the moment
@aspen818 Haha hopefully Kevin isnt buying what Lydias saying Now Jeff and Jordan are talking outside theyre a cute couple
@aspen818 Yes they are still in the room Lydia is starting to cry shes overwhelmed with being nominated and all
@aspen818 Idk they havent showed anyone else for the past few min
Kevin and Lydias alliance seems onesided
@ebolacolas Definitely I want her to leave I hope Kevin doesnt use the POV on her
@aspen818 True but maybe Kevin will be better off
@ebolacolas I agree what makes her think Kevin will want to use the POV on her when shes talking to him like that
Wow Kevin should really consider breaking away from his alliance with Lydia
Ugh I hate how Lydia is trying to make Kevin feel guilty
Kevin and Lydia talking in the green roomhmm Lydias definitely giving him an attitude
@ebolacolas I know Hopefully Jeff uses it on Thursday so she can be proved wrong
Lydia thinks she knows what the mystery power entails haha
Russ looks really mad for some reason like he wants to start trouble with the next person who looks at him the wrong way
Jordan looks like she wants to laugh in Jessies face while hes trash talking Russ haha
Wow Jessie making a huge antiRuss speech
@aspen818 Im not sure she just said it a few minutes ago though Shes talking to Jessie and Nat right now
Jordan getting mad at Jeff a bit
@aspen818 Haha Yea I think I made Jeff sound a little insane
@aspen818 I think hes just trying to get close to everyone just in case they have the mystery power
Oops yea what Jessie said thanks @aspen
Lol uhmI guess its onesided with Jessies love for Jordan
Jeff should really confront Russ about what Jeff told him
@giselledsouza Yes that would be hiarious nice talking to you too
@giselledsouza Haha Last night she was talking about how she thinks Jessies cute I think shes attracted to him beyond friend status
@aspen818 I wonder if he was lying about what Russ said
@giselledsouza Yes I wonder if Natalie would still be in the house if she didnt become so close with him I hate how much she follows him
Jessie trying to seek assurance with Jeff in case he has the mystery power which he does
@giselledsouza hes on
@giselledsouza Haha Id rather have Natalie go home first thoughJessie can go later or something I like him but I dont like what side
@aspen818 Haha me too I didnt like how Natalie came out of nowhere though she was random
@giselledsouza Me too I was rooting for him all last week to get it
Anyone else think they swear too much on bb after dark
@aspen818 Yes that speech was very unnecessary What is up with everyones speeches this season Some of them are crazy
@aspen818 I agree Ronnie was really annoying clever at times though
@giselledsouza I know I wonder how cold that water really is
@aspen818 Ive just recently started liking Russ especially because he teamed up with Jeff

In the Globe Slumps strikeouts dog Howard Teixeira  httpisgd4MIKH redsox
He added Theyre special fans and they will always have my respect
Pedro said I know they dont like the Yankees to win not even in Nintendo games of Boston fans rooting for him tomorrow
Asked if everyone was making too big a deal out of the short rest for the pitchers CC said Big time
In the Globe Phillies 8 Yankees 6 Phillies still in World Series chase thanks to Utley homers  httpisgd4LPjA redsox
@bmorrow10 I firmly believe that Posada should have started this game Yankees needed him in a weakened lineup
Thats it for AJ Good thing Molina started  or it might have been even worse Umm
Four batters three runs no outs Three days rest isnt looking so good for AJ so far
Utley proves he can hit a Yankees pitcher other than CC
Ramiro Pena is the sub for Melky Cabrera on the Yankees World Series roster
Hazen will be staying with the RedSox instead of going to Padres with Hoyer per baseball source Good news for Sox player development
That looks about right RT @seantanu @AmalieBenjamin This the cupcake httpbitly41wcAM
That would be Reading Terminal Market Whoops
At the Reading Market Terminal where theres a cupcake with a sign Yankees steroid cupcake no flavor no character NY logo on it
In the Globe Yankees 7 Phillies 4 Damon sparks late Yankee uprising  httpisgd4KS1L redsox
Thats 11 straight for Blanton every batter since he hit ARod
Thats the 10th K for Ryan Howard in the World Series
 @IanMBrowne I just way backed Utleys double Jerry Trupiano style
Congrats @MSGTina for running the marathon Very impressive Shes missed around the Red Sox of course
ARod has now been hit three times in the last two games Warnings go out to both dugouts fans boo Girardi out to talk to umps
Heard the weather was pretty nice today in Boston Cant quite say the same for Philly Cold here but no rain Thank goodness
In the Globe Yankees 8 Phillies 5 ARod Yankees swing into action  httpisgd4JTAo redsox
@bmorrow10 Hurts the Yankees in that they would rather have not had to use him tonight
Line of media waiting to get into the Yanks clubhouse was so long that some bailed to go over to the Phillies side Never seen it that bad
Phillies at least get Rivera in the game Still down by three runs but having to bring in Mo hurts the Yankees
It is now raining Again
Thats it for Cole Hamels I can now see why Charlie Manuel wants him to start a potential Game 7 Or not
Home run is the call
Going to the replay on that double
Posada cant get the weight off his bat Jeter couldnt get his off earlier Weird
That was a 1 hour 20 minute rain delay First pitch 917 pm
Tarp is coming off the field now First pitch is scheduled for 915 pm
Just started absolutely pouring here in Philadelphia
Last years Game 3 in Philly was delayed an hour and 31 minutes at the start Just sayin
The rain seems to be getting lighter and theres movement on the field guys stretching etc Those are good signs
Theyre rolling out the tarp on the field yankees phillies
@therealtuthill Thats a joke right Just checking
Now that I can reveal my vote I had Bailey first on my AL Rookie of the Year ballot Bailey beat out Andrus for the top spot
Varitek exercised his player option Hell be back with the RedSox next year as the backup Good choice by him Nothing else out there
Source also said Hermida might not factor into the team in 2010 Appears to be some early insurance for the RedSox
Baseball source said RedSox made the deal bc they got Hermida on the cheap and theres a chance he performs better than did with FL
The RedSox have just confirmed that they traded for Hermida from the Marlins Hunter JonesJose Alvarez on their way to FL
In the Globe Yankees 7 Phillies 3 27th in a Series  httpisgd4NH14 redsox
As Cashman tried to get into clubhouse he asked me what ppl in Boston were thinking this week Told him there were a lot of Phillies fans
Matsui got the MVP
Some random guy just got caught with Pedro and reporters Yelled Whos your daddy Talked over Pedros interview Classy
Three months til Fort Myers
Thats it Yankees win 73 They were spilling out of the dugout before Cano even made the throw to 1B
You can clearly see the excitement in the Yankees dugout All guys on the railing High fives jumping up and down
 @FenwayWest @AmalieBenjamin like a used CC Sabathia buffet plate
@AssignGuy Meant that the Phillies have three more outs to try to change the outcome
Three outs to go before the Yankees are the 2009 World Series champs How are all of you feeling
@GlobeChadFinn Now youre just getting greedy
@GlobeChadFinn Nevermind
@GlobeChadFinn Its far too cold in the Yankee Stadium press box for us to be there that long
Six RBI for Matsui ties a WS record
Pettitte had quite a long conversation with Joe West on his way back to the dugout Someone had to go coax him away
Strained right calf for Damon Hairston replaced him at the start of the 4th in left field

What do we learn from the web that we didnt know already That there is a seething mass of unspeakable rage just over the horizon

ON STATING THE OBVIOUS If its obvious it shouldnt upset anyone right
NABOKOV I taught thought to mimic an imperial transmitter an awesome messenger carrying my order of selfdestruction to my own brain

Globe article by Nick Zaino  httpbitly16YFAz
I have two modes submissive and superlative
GOD made the choice for me  My social life was spared despite me  I dodged the Jewish rock bullet  And for that I thank Yahweh
My point is this back in 1994 I would not have had the good sense to kick this loser to the curb
He had to delete my wall post because his label monitors his facebook page
His Josh Nelsons music consistently leaves audiences with strong feelings of community
The Josh Nelson Project is a perfect choice for community concerts inspiring Shabbat services and artist residencies
Each musician is young Jewish and a positive role model
Delivering highoctane Jewish rock the Josh Nelson Project is five of the most talented performers in the United States
Because now Josh Nelson is one of the most popular performers and producers in modern Jewish music
He delete my wallpost  Why you ask
I find him  And gently inform him that Im a standup comedian  And that my memory is long
 years later
So I look for him on Facebook on a whim
He rejected me  He stood me up once  Wreckage of the heart
I made a few desperate attempts to find him
The next morning he took to a girl Barryanne  He left me for a girl and her name was Barryanne
I instantly fell in love
We were on a chorus retreat  And it changed me at the cellular level
my first kiss from a boy came when I was 17 years old
okay this one is going to take multiple tweets  my first kiss

Just starting a new account for business use
 @CinBengalsNFL Chris Henry has sustained a forearm fracture Could be done for the year
BOOMING kickoffs from Gostkowski Penalty backed up kickoff to 25 still put it through the end zone Moss gave him high5 coming off field
By the way  That stuff with Pat White was NOT Wildcat football That was spreadoption Wildcat implies that RB is acting as option QB
By the way  603 left if the second Dolphins have 140 yards of total offense Miami had 104 all game vs Jets
Wow Dolphins just jammed ball down Pats throats running WVUs offense Speed option out of pistol Zoneread option Wildcat speed sweep
Told folks this  Dolphins are running option football Repeat after me  Not A Gimmick
Wow  Pat White lines up in the pistol runs option keeps for 33 yards
Vontae Davis walking of quad injury return questionable walking the sideline Jason Allen seems to have replaced him w1st defense
Vontae Davis just climbed on an exercise bike on the sideline so looks like hell be OK
Key stats Dolphins have 8 rushing yards  Patriots winning TOP battle through 1 quarter
 @grazdanny NFL record for catches in a game is 20 by Terrell Owens in 2000 Colts Dallas Clark just caught 8 in the first quarter
Vontae Davis down on the field for the Dolphins Trainers heading out to the tend to him
Bodden who was shaken up returns to the game for Pats New England needs him  Hennes hitting his rhythm
Patriots respond quickly  Moss 36yard catch on fade to his outside shoulder the key 73 New England
Even though it took a 52yd FG thats exactly what Dolphins needed  10 plays 354 off the clock tempo of game slowed down
By the way great great pick by Vontae Davis Could be case of a kid hearing all week how he was gonna get beat like a drum responding 
Tully BantaCain gets the quarterback on the play
Looks like thats getting overturned Miami should get the ball back secondand10 at 
 Turner Moses Ferguson for Phins
Inactives  Edelman Taylor Wilhite Morris Alexander Ohrnberger Light Green for Pats Thigpen Sheets Crowder Gardner Murtha 
Dolphins downgrade Ferguson Crowder to out for Pats game tomorrow
Edelman Morris Taylor Green Light out for Pats  Wilhite Warren Watson questionable  Moss Brady probable
We got Bradys response to Porters comments on the rules right here httpisgd4P5XC
 @realpatriots The Patriots have released OL Kendall Simmons
Edelman Taylor Wilhite Morris Simmons Light Green missing from pats practice on shells
Wow  RT @OmarKelly Drew Rosenhaus blames Bills struggles on coaching qb play and said Bills offensive line is the worst in the NFL
Edelman Taylor Morris Light Green and Wilhite those missing from Patriots practice held in shorts and shells
@WAD1980 Thought it was interesting anyway Well see

 @kerryrhodes start spreading the news lol i called it yankees in 6 world series champs again now its our turn
 Ricky used to be a bulldozer and has worked himself to become a perimeter threat For all the crap he gets thats pretty impressive
Think about how Ricky Williams has reinvented himself  Belichick says Id say Ronnie Browns the more powerful of the two 
 @AdamSchefter Filed to ESPN The Kansas City Chiefs claimed WR Chris Chambers on waivers So hes staying in the AFC West
Sorry  In midst of my job orientation forgot to link this here Jarvis Green out 24 wks after having knee scoped httpisgd4M6Io
Huge 15yard sack by Bart Scott to force Dolphins punt out of deep in their own territory create field position for offense
Great shoestring catch by Keller 522 left Dolphin lead dwn to 3027 Hope those that left are enjoying smooth sailing on the NJ Turnpike
Noticed some Jets fans filing for the exits Reminds me of Foxboro in Week 1 I mean theres 841 left and the deficit is 11 not 
Funny moment here  Meadowlands crowd gives Jets kick coverage team a standing o for finally tackling Teddy Ginn
The Sanchise now coming alive Looking better this quarter after firsthalf ineptitude
Say this too  That Tony Sparano sure knows how to push the right buttons with his players Kind of like a certain boss of his once did
Biggest problem with Quinn in my opinion  No touch I honestly thnk hes gt a lot of plusses But cant seem to take enough off fastball
Classic Gruden line as teams get heated Remember if the Baltimore Ravens wore their throwbacks they would be the Cleveland Browns
 @TroyAikman Belichick gave Peyton ultmte compliment  Pytn prved him right He played 2 win didnt worry about scrutiny I applaud him
Interesting  Gruden on day ESPN extension is announced says If I ever coach again  in conversation Is it really a question
 @mortreport As for Pats ball spot NFL VP Mike Pereira happy w linesman for being in perfect position  Still great play by Bullitt
Costly penalty by Butler there Maybe it was a minor tug but you pull the jersey youll get called for it every time
Big play by Koppen to cover that ball Mathis is eating Kaczurs lunch
That was an impressive march by the Colts Patriots 3121 Not over yet
Sportaphile
Thats the second turnover the Colts gathered in their own endzone Add that to a thirddown redzone sack and theyve limited damage
Wow Huge play by Colts defense
Bullitts down now That would be a tough loss for Colts Jamie Silva has come in to the game
Looks like the ball just slipped from Mannings grip My guess is that Bodden and Chung arent doing much celebrating after that penalty
Addai returns to the game for Indy Great play design on defense by Colts crossing safeties to throw off Brady
Second big drop by a young Colts receiver First Garcon then Collie Both drivekillers
Now both Addai finger and Simpson head are down for Colts Lots on Donald Brown going forward
Derrick Burgess gets to Manning forces rushed throw By far his best game as a Patriot even if he sits out the second half
Ninkovitch down on the field right knee injury Trainers are there Big third down coming up
Garcons down beyond the end zone Losing him would mean more two tights less flexibility for Colts
Brady bailed Kaczur out of getting beaten a second time for a sack by Kaczur bought his own time to get the ball to Edelman
 Vollmer was oneonone there on Freeney and contain him Great job by the rookie
And thats how it is on DBs Bethea was right there and Moss still made the play Patriots 17 Colts 
Adalius Thomas was by the way in for that threeandout by the Colts as a rush end
Pretty glaring that Adalius Thomas isnt getting snaps defensively even with BantaCain hurt
BantaCain rib is questionable to return Nice pressure by his replacement Ninkovitch on that thirddown play
Brady throw to the post to Moss absolutely perfect Patriots answer Colts right back Could be getting a shootout here
Patriots for one reason or another seemed to back off Clark late in that last drive Theyd had McGowan lining over DC right at the line
Tully BantaCain down on the field trainers tending to him
Field caught fire at Lucas Oil Stadium Not kidding 50yardline needed to be squirted down with Gatorade bottles after fireworks
Impressive drive by Colts  8 plays 90 yards Manning goes 5of6 for 87 yards on march with touchdown pass on screen to Addai
 And my guess is theres no way its overturned Manning by rushing team to line just got Patriots to burn a timeout
Amazing  Brady Manning trade threeandouts to start But Colts got it moving now Spectacular throwcatch by Manning and Wayne there
Gotta hand it to the Bengals  Sweeping both Pittsburgh and Baltimore Theyre a good bet for one of AFC byes esp wmanageable schedule
Moss back at practice  Edelman Taylor Green Alexander Tate Meriweather Morris Light Green absent Baker in noncontact jersey
Im hearing no RT @kbkcstar LJ appears to be in Dallas At the moment hes in downtown Dallas Cowboys possible
 @SIRossTucker Contrary 2 popular opinion NFL players love playing a Thu night game No pads in practice that week and the weekend off
Belichick on Larry Johnson Well discuss that organizationally here this afternoon
Pats DC Dean Pees on Planning 4 Peyton A lot of it comes down to execution  They do what they do and we do what we do
Caserio says well talk organizationally about putting a claim in on Larry Johnson Very vague But says hes happy wrunning backs
Steelers starting to look like a threat to repeat Huge game at Cincy Sunday
Hint of excitement on Colts in Belichicks voice at end of EEI apprnce This will be a good one this week Were looking forward to this
Belichick says on WEEI of the possibility the Patriots could claim Larry Johnson off waivers I would doubt it
C Dan Koppen just walked through the locker room no brace no limp
Cutting Larry Johnson may have been necessary but you have to wonder about the message  He gets his  and freedom by running his mouth
 @OGOchoCinco Miles Austin does it againAwesome reciever
Gotta hand it to the Cowboys tonight  Thats showing up on a very big stage And churning out 1st downs to close it out was impressive
This is dead on A sign how wellcoached Fins are RT @kerryrhodes miami just finds ways to stay in games it baffles me but they do
Bradys 27th 300yard game today  new club record eclipsing Drew Bledsoe
Good job staying home by Thomas on doublereverse Did look like a facemask from here though Have to get a better look
Mayo up and looks OK Maybe wind knocked out of him
Bad news for Patriots  Mayo down on the field Looks like some sort of upperbody injury
And the Patriots answer right back Thirdand1 Moss runs a drag reached low to grab it stiffarms Davis gone 71yard TD
That drive Exactly what Dolphins need to do  like novacaine  16 plays 66 yards 1009 off the clock Miami leads

Hes going over the different medications that can be used  there are many
Allergy shots can be given but it takes a long time to work Dr BuSaba says
Environmental irritants are also hard to control Try to avoid dust pets if you are allergic
Dr BuSaba said smoking  and even secondhand smoke  makes sinusitis worse
Dr B said nasal sprays should not be used more than 3 days or yoiu may get a rebound affect and feel more stuffed up
Nasal irrigation is a sinus patients best friend Thats squirting salt water in the nose
The doc said that atleast half of infections will go away on their own without antibiotics But antibiotics can speed the process
The goal of many of the medical treatment is to open the nasal passage and to thin the mucus he says
The audience loves Dr BuSaba  he is very personable and makes them laugh
Dr B said it is much harder to cure chronic sinusitis than an infection  his goal is to make life liveable with  sinusitis
Dr BuSaba said he grew up in the middle east and his mother used olive oil as the cure for everything He will mention other options
Dr BuSaba is going to talk about medical treatment for sinusitis now
Dr Rho finished speaking and is being asked questions
Dr Rho says if you have nasal symptoms for more than 2 months if you have 4 episodesyear you may want to see an ENT doc
Mucus with allergies is usually thin  it is usually thick and you have fever etc with a sinus infection
The common cold gets better in 3 to 5 days If your symptoms worsen or persist you may have bacterial sinusitis
Dr Rho said most patients with sinusitis do not have bacterial infections and will not be helped with antibiotics
Many factor can increase sinusitis  allergies anatomy medications pollution smoking dental disease and more
An acute sinus infection lasts up to 4 wwek
Its mucus that stays in the nose too long that causes problems Mucus is meant to move or you will get swelling and infection
Dr Rho says the sinuses are alive and can make up to a quart of mucus in a 24 hour period
Going over the anatomy of the nose And there is no such thing as a perfect nose
Dr Rho says sinusitis one of the top 8 most common diagnosis It costs over 37 million annually and affects quality of life

It is high noon and Dr H is wraping up We are ending this live Tweet Thanks so much for following @masseyeandear Have a great weekend
The take home @masseyeandear docs will use the type of treatmentsurgery to fit the patient
Traditional endoscopic sinus surgery has been refined and improved over the years and is now less tramatic than before Dr H explains
There are advantages and disadvantages to the balloon method as you can imagine
Hes now describing balloon sinuplasty  pretty interesting way to widen the turbinates
Some surgeons use packing after surgery some dont People usually have bruising Again it varies Dr H says
Dr H says any details about surgical time effects and recovery time vary by person Some people go back to work the next day
The audience just laughed Dr H said his wife came up with the FAQS about sinus surgery that he is going over now
Dr Holbrook is describing imageguided sinus surgery When used the doc can see exactly were he is in the patients head
Hes now showing a video of a nose that has had surgery and that is working well That nose is a better place
Dr Holbrook is showing a cool video of the inside of the nose  its a scary place
Sinus surgery is usually done to widen the turbanates the doc says
Dr Holbrooks says he carefully considers when surgery should be used Some surgeries may lower the need for medicines
Dr  Eric Holbrook is the next speaker and will discuss the surgica treatment of sinusitis Surgery is the last resort
Different antibiotics may have to be tried if the patient has used a lot of antibiotics in the past
All patients love antibiotics Dr B said The audience laughed

@nwjerseyliz Oh hehe I was thinking more that what would have been scandalous years ago is no longer because of evolution of society
@nwjerseyliz Hehe so true Time is usually the champion of irrational discrimination Thats the best solace for many people these days
@nwjerseyliz There was nothing about Lamberts performance that indicated a GG Allin risk to GMA more than Madonna or Lady Gaga might
@nwjerseyliz True and I think most controversial performers have been able to make that switch What happened here to make ABC think diff
@MichaelSheeley Will do thanks
@MichaelSheeley oO How does one get double private super top secret beta access
@nwjerseyliz You really think so How many controversial performers have performed on morning television before
@nwjerseyliz unfortunately the definition of too raunchy in this case is predicated on discrimination
@nwjerseyliz But if nobody complains about it the rating spike wont occur A positive outcome doesnt justify ignoring the discrimination

@WaltNew The fans were cheated by last years Finals The Cavs shouldve faced the Lakers instead if KG was injured
@Oz617 Itll improve with time but if Rondo was a better shooter hed be a different point guard  not as pass firstpush the tempoattack
@UncommonRecords The Lakers couldnt be intimidated outtoughed  manhandled by the Cs anymore Mental toughness was there now I dunno
@UncommonRecords I saw those games in 2005 Im talking about 
@WaltNew That has no bearing on Kobe vs Pierce when theyre healthy Kobe earned nickname from Shaq from merking Kobe mind you LOL
@DYLANefinTHOMAS Exactly
@Oz617 Id agree with that
@UncommonRecords I think that last years Lakers had a shot to beat the Celtics fair  square in the Finals They just didnt GET to
@UncommonRecords Sure didntI gotta figure out what year Im talking about Not 
@WaltNew Luke Walton Bill Waltons progeny
@DwaDa He isnt acting like it
@UncommonRecords Im talking about Mel Daniels I got it all on tape
@WaltNew The Lakers are all one ring dudes w the exception of Fish  Kobe thoughBlank stare
@UncommonRecords Ron Artest owned Pierce when he was so frustrated by him in the playoffs that he fought the Pacers assistant coach once
Its like how Chris Paul is the best young PG in the NBA but he always ends up in the minus when he goes against Rondo regardless of stats
@UncommonRecords We got a guy called Sheed And a dude named Marquis And a dude called Big Baby They dont even START
@PpWwCc He IS However my 2008 NBA Championship tapes have me thinking that vs Pierce theyre evenly matched They need to play NOW tho
Re Paul PierceKobe Bryant Until Kobe bodies Paul Pierce in a 7 game series  wins Finals MVP Ill think that way Kobegtother cats
@MissRissa Was that directed towards me LOL
Im out for the night but before I go Paul PierceKobe Bryant Switches to Safari on iPod Touch  checks Celtics schedule
I really need to see these two squads battle it out soon That was a hell of a shot from Kobe Damn

by the way keep suggestions coming  site can only get better with your help  I hope you all realize that  thanks
after getting feedback on beta we are thinking of bringing back tree and tabs  seems like peeps use gotapi for more then just text search
@pappy thanks for feedback We are thinking of bringing back tree in single API mode but ALL API mode will not have tree  too hard to do
@zefer we appreciate feedback could you tell us a bit more on why the old version is more attractive then new one Thanks
httpbetagotapicom for those who missed beta announcement yesterday night
@dgiunta so glad you like it we changed things around so we were not sure how people find new way
go to httpbetagotapicom if you dont want to read blog and want to jump right into the midst of things enjoy
Beta is ON httpideknet99Q to report problembug drop us quick email info@gotapicom for suggestions you can also use feedback section
@jaredgrippe I confused you I didnt mean APIs themselves I meant API documentation references site that serves html with help
fun fact  erlang is the only api site with DoS attack protection crawler has to sleep for 5 sec after each URL not to be blacklisted 
@davejoyce glad to be of any help 
going to add dojo API  for those unaware it is yet another AJAX framework people like
I wonder if anyone cared for hadoop javadoc being part of gotapi  let me know if there are such people
Should have mentioned earlier but rubyonrailsorg is back to normal now so gotapi can be used for rails lookup now
rubyonrailsorg has problems with DNS or something  that obviously affects Ruby Rails look up at gotapi I hope they fix problem soon
@robolson we are hurrying  had to take rest though before final push
gotapi team had little 3day vacation  now back to work Still struggling with javascript guys  UI is being changed very much beta soon
open search plugin httpwwwopensearchorg will be available in 20 firefox supports open search
yesterday crawled flex 33 and actionscript 30 Also JSTL 11 At this point no more crawling finalizing UI and preparing for beta
@akyrho sorry to keep you waiting at this point all APIs are updated we are just finalizing UI and search features beta is coming soon
good news for functional programmers out there haskell libraries will be added to v20 contribution by Christian Muirhead thanks Chris
just discovered that all links to functions in erlang doc contribution are not working one more reason to take over
@samuraicoder we lack good imagesicons but you can use icon that @cyberfox created httptinyurlcomdmw2un
@depi I crawled latest CakePHP couple of weeks ago it is just sitting waiting to be deployed as part of v20 thanks for your interest
for java developers out there planning on combining most apache commons javadoc in one resource module IO NET Collections etc
@nw v20 will come out within next month we are doing our best to make it happen asap seriously
@robolson UI will change so old bugs will go away and new stuff we will test it in several browsers also there will be beta to try it out
Just added myself to the httpwefollowcom twitter directory under  search api gotapi
in v20 adding mootools api from httpwwwmootoolsnetdocs
@caniszczyk my bad then could you point to javadoc for latest eclipse platform api Id appreciate the help thanks
Adding eclipse 20 and osgi 41 javadocs to the roster I think these are latest versions  correct me if I am wrong cheers
taking over Orb API contribution orb api needs more keywords and less intro how to info gotapi is all about fast keyword lookup
@voituk we plan on opening beta for 20 within next month likely betagotapicom then we will release i will make sure to post updates
@mcmire thanks for feedback that is what I keep hearing so far so there is good chance we will drop sergios doc

Small businesses still trying to view social media via the perspective of traditional marketing and advertising That wont work

Decent strength in biotechs so far DNDN MNKD OGXI HGSI 
added to ARST at 227 will keep todays low 224 as a tight stop on my added position 
@MonsterTrader thx still going to keep a tight stop on my added position in case the breakout fails
watching DNDN here tightening up around the 29 level could buy here with todays low as a stop 
watch ININ for a breakout above 2050 
watch GMCR for a possible break above 70 
HGSI recovering nicely so far worth watching for a move above the 20502075 area 
GMCR broke 70 nxt target breakout is alltime high area around 72 could do it in the nxt week or so support should be 6667 
RIMM is strong today should run ahead of its earnings after the close on Thurs 
NTES weak today but I like how it found support EXACTLY on its 10 wk moving average this morn at 4313 still like it longterm 
mentioned DNDN earlier at 29 with todays low as a stop could buy it here at 2925 and move up the stop to 2875 
@mumboz its tough to give advice on a stock not knowing ur timeframe in general I dont like stocks trading below their 50day moving avg
@DougKass every time u mention ur March bottom call I hear Springsteens Glory Days in the background uve been short 4 the past 2 months
@mumboz very good pt the difference is that GMCR came back after consolidating for a month my best guess is that STEC will do the same
@mumboz in other words STEC could be dead money  trade in the 2632 range for a while whatever u choose my best advice is 2 keep stops
watching FIRE for a possible move above the 222225 range 
I agree with what @terranovajoe said on midday FastMoney show if oil continues to break down mkt will have trouble recovering today 
Many have tried to call the top for the past 2 months just like they tried to call the bottom all fall of 08 a waste of time IMHO 
Id rather focus on the stocks instead of trying to be a superhero calling the top and so far stocks are still holding up well 
Mentioned DNDN twice earlier today its acting VERY strong should continue to run ahead of its Analyst Day this Thurs 924

I think an important part of promotion to is to offer something unique that other writers arent offering   Increase Value writechat
@Saffy Thats a great idea  I bet its a useful way to get a grasp on your character isnt it
@CDominiqueG The more the better  If youre not posting AT LEAST once a week theres no point  Once a day is ideal
@whenwelisten Yep  And a great way to get those back visits is to have a signature with your url rather than pushing your url in content
 @KarlBimshas Its less about promotions and more about building a community of those who are interested in what you write writechat
@HoodedMan And for those of you thats great  I wish I was one of you    Thats why I date a graphic designer  writechat
@jcharbonneau I dont but Ill definitely check out her page  Thanks for the suggestion  writechat

Is it ever too early to start promotion  Should you wait until close to published  writechat I know my answer
@TamaraNKitties Im always forgetting to check my Google Reader too writechat
@MerBlackwood Id never really thought about that last part  Good advice   writechat
Agreed RT @CDominiqueG @JeanLevasseur Of course not You promote whenever you can even  before agent contracts and publication writechat
@HoodedMan Question to that then is should you start promoting yourself as a writer even before the book is ready writechat
 @KarlBimshas @JeanLevasseur The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago  The next best is today writechat
@WritingSpirit Is that such a terrible thing  Youll also have all of their feedback and support writechat
@HoodedMan Wow  Thats cutting it close  Were you happy with the result what was the book  writechat
@groovymystery Was that your first booki or had you been published before writechat
@CDominiqueG Thats the challenge  Even when I am blogging when I do for various companies I always fall short sometimes writechat

@BostonWeddingJP There was a big gasp in the press box when Vlad got hit Then there was another gasp when they showed the replay Ouch
@IanMBrowne Boy I sure missed something interesting if Drew was hitting Brian Anderson
Reddick hitting for Varitek here redsox
Thats Gonzalezs first walk with the RedSox at least this time around
Lowries out in the ondeck circle with Drew at bat Lowrie would hit for Dusty Brown redsox
@smokesbandits Kottaras is still left in the dugout
Nine pitches on that walk by Green to tie the game Scioscia looks like his head is about to explode redsox
Fantastic game No question Lowrie Green craziness redsox
Green rushed off to trainers room before talking Said he had to find out whats wrong with him after leg buckled after ball 4 redsox
Ortiz I feel like Barry Bonds tonight redsox
Ortiz quote was in reference to starting the rally with the twoout walk redsox
Green said he was fighting for his life with a dead right leg that he hadnt told anyone about Nearly collapsed couple times redsox

@bucktowntiger You seem strangely DOWN this morning Is something wrong
@uconntam Ew Thats never good
@ccchapman Sounds familiar I always thought marketing PR and sales were just three flavors in the same bowl of ice cream
@uconntam See I see it as ME working harder for YOU so you can ask the venues for more money after a while  
@ccchapman Any small business owner realizes that theyre all the same dept  Why do they get so divided in big companies
 @nlowell marketing is what you do before sales  PR is what you do after because your marketing failed  Ha That is the best desc
@ccchapman See I always thought marketing and PR were vehicles to push sales Cause without sales whats the point
Theres a difference between being accessible and wanting to chat all day long Im working my ass off but I dont want to be invisible
@Ihnatko Could be worse Ive had Total Eclipse of the Heart  Literal Version images stuck in my head for days now What the effing crap

@dragoneer If I were you Id shut down new FA signups for a while

@DraikeDawnfire If they show up at a con tho they have to take their heads off sometime And someone out their might be too happy to help
@DraikeDawnfire Yeah I worry about them They dont need to lay low they need to find a whole new fandom

Crappy Joba by Joba  RT @BryanHoch Threerun homer for Ken Griffey Jr and the Mariners have put up seven runs on Joba Chamberlain

Wow Leftwich really really sucks bucs nfl
Come on Fred Jackson I got you in both leagues bills
Wow T O with a horrible drop wide open bills
 @injuryexpert RT @MattMaiocco RB Frank Gore right ankle sprain is questionable to return

Re TO Its a lot easier to catch TDs when youre up 9 and running out the clock play action is almost indefensible bills
All the same bills offense has some weapons now especially when Lynch comes back
Huge win for da bears
No problem I just need Romo to throw about 6 TDs and 400 yds to win my fantasyfootball matchup
