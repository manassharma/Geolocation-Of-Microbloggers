It is an 11 hour drive from my house to Philadelphia Why did it take me this long to make up my mind to fly to the Conj
@raganwald @mjlangford It saves me at least an hour of my life 5 days a week
My first reaction was that MySQL was optimized for beginners Now I think it is designed for people who hate databases
@clojureconj trying to fill out the survey for which talks I want to go to  Might be easier if you doubled the length and just did 1 track
@jeremyheiler eventual comprehensibility
Woo hoo I know what I am doing this evening 
Datomic Yes I am practically a Tardis  All the reason you need to read Conversations with Datomic 
@ktcoders Is there anything I should be installing or learning this week to get ready for the training this weekend
@gigasquid Thats a happy accident
@jeremyheiler Yep Then my schedule changed I have never more happily paid a change fee
I know NY area doesnt mean that the airport will actually be IN NY Why didnt I pay attention to which airport when I bought the ticket
@thepunningman @demmer12 Thats a circular argument

@caolan @shaunlebron I want to go see it again anyway  Now I have something to look for
@swannodette well I do have all of those sky miles
I am looking forward to presenting an Intro to Clojure at the Atlanta Code Camp 
@mrbbk @swannodette That is terrible
@airportyh Thanks it was great to watch that again Here is one of my favorites 
Thank you to all the people who worked to put on @strangeloopstl I cant even express what a great experience it was to attend
@gigasquid @strangeloopstl woo hoo  See you there
@jeremyheiler That is a relief to hear
@adriennefriend every time
@danbjson @lexicallyscoped @omegapointab Do you recommend reading Continuous Integration before Continuous Delivery
@adriennefriend I once sat next to a user of software I wrote Hearing her say This system sucks hurt I learned a lot from that
This weekend I listened to @jessitron on the @cognicast Today I am writing better tests 
Women of Atlanta dont miss your chance to get started building websites at this free event   
@swannodette @ktcoders Its only 900 miles tempting
@kyro @gortok Wow how do you get the amplitude to decrease like that
@briprowe Sounds like a good day to me
@adriennefriend is already doing lots for the ATL dev community Help her so she can have more to share 
@aaroniba @sgrove I could never remember if it was else or default Eventually I realized why both worked
I am amazed the rate at which @pluralsight produces interesting courses Should I watch Flux or Cassandra first
@sgrove I was about to say You must be in Atlanta Looking at your profile I guess they must offer that service nationwide
Rent Path is looking for Sr Clojure devs  100 remote
@adriennefriend I had no idea email could be such a formal occasion
@gigasquid Happy Birthday
Every time 
@6 @borkdude I never knew what it did but couldnt imagine why I would want to run without it

@meltar If you are using a hammer you dont need the manual
@meltar @tholmes Who is having a better day
@ShawnWildermuth I thought of several responses but no suggestions so I will keep them to my self
@mrbbk I guess I dont have to ask if you are enjoying the book you are reading 
@ShawnWildermuth The mall @ New PtreeChambleeDunwoody has Hot Pot Food Court also good Buford hwy is also good for authentic Chinese
@MarkStringer @otfrom You might get me with Ice Cream cake

Thanks @jcrossley3 and @tcrawley for a great presentation on @Immutant 2x last night
@VesperLangford @mjlangford Welcome
@gigasquid haha what did you buy
@ShawnWildermuth This is how I do React 
@briprowe You talked me into it  Just bought it and it is next on my reading list
That was my first thought when I heard about the pragprog sale Thanks for the reminder 
@gigasquid Hah considering the source I was expecting killer robots Should have realized that isnt something you are scared of
@briprowe Oh you are from NY do you know my friend 
@mbanzi @lispmeister Well reasoned argument completely the opposite of my intuition Great article
@VentureAtlanta @GAAtlanta link takes me to a page with a bar at the top and nothing else Tried chrome firefox amp safari
@mrbbk It is nice that he can work on the train
conf looks like a lot of fun 
@jcrossley3 That should be on one of those lists of lifehacks
@gortok Good idea Unfortunately I am reading over coffee not wine so I am not vowing anything But it is a good idea
@seancorfield @strangeloopstl Is there a conference hotel I didnt see any mention of it
7 days left to fund gradual typing in Clojure   
@jtcummiatl That is pretty neat  There are a group of us working our way through SICP at work  I will have to show them that
@antiheroine Would it defeat the purpose if we come in from out of town
I am sure the book is even better but the SICP lectures are one hell of a computer science education 
@mtrimpe @AnnaPawlicka Thanks for those links  Amazing stuff
@AnnaPawlicka Cool video The focus and the timing I kept asking is this real Dont know where they got the idea but it was really great
@hyperlinda @plexus Growing up in upstate NY in the 80s guys was definitely unisex At least now I notice now when I say it progress
Every once in a while I just stop what I am doing and think Om without cursors  What will that be like
@jeremyheiler I have the same problem with the HR system at work
@chrishouser Nice  I think I have only seen through season 7
@chrishouser Oh no is the series over I have one more episode of Luther and then I was going to look for more Foyles War
@antiheroine you may have just motivated me to get out more
@AnnaPawlicka @apkeedle congrats
@PyLadiesATL Hey thanks for checking 2nd Tuesday of the month for ATLCLJ
@meltar Seldom are mixed metaphors so disturbing
@vincentmayers Awesome I wanted to go to that talk but I was at a conference
I definitely want to check that out 
@shanselman Only when I miss the escape key
@kaborso Thats great  Good Luck
@kaborso Wow  What are you going to study
I am looking forward to reading this 
There was so much so good at ClojureWest but this project programming Clojure in other human languages is heroic 
@cognitect thanks for putting on a great conference
@dpp At least the kids arrive
@jtcummiatl I am really looking forward to your presentation about GorillaREPL at the Atlanta Clojure meetup on Tuesday
@adriennefriend @DjangoConEurope @pyladies That is awesome congratulations
@gigasquid I wasnt worried until I saw that the first picture on their carousel was the terminator
swirl is a really good R tutorial  
@adriennefriend The Atlanta Clojure meetup typically meets the 2nd Tues each month The best place to get info is  
Great presentation and even better discussion at the Atlanta Clojure meetup tonight
@gigasquid Instead of explosives couldnt you send in the robots
@devnexus is finally here I will be talking about the Clojure features that really matter for app developers in Ballroom D at 230
@bitquabit @gortok At least they know how to take the reservation
Time to redo my slide deck @swannodette broke my CLJS REPL too complicated slide  devnexus
@swannodette Ok  If I read the directions it all works just fine
@swannodette rlwrap java cp cljsjarsrc clojuremain replclj  rlwrap not found for me removing it gabe me a browser repl
Did someone fix Clojure stack traces Trying to force one for a demo had to divide by 0 inside a go block to get more than a single line
@jessitron @searls Wow that sounds like a great way to evaluate any metric
Counting the days until @devnexus
@jasonbelldata @otfrom Please blog about this
Just got an email that @devnexus tickets are nearly sold out March is a usually nice in Atlanta You should come visit
@sehnaoui @mtrimpe Somebody warn @gigasquid
@gigasquid Looks like a really cool format
Just got my ClojureWest ticket
Woo Hoo  I will be speaking at @devnexus
Exciting to see so many Clojure libraries on the ThoughtWorks radar 
Yet another error that would have been caught with type checking I Really need to try out coretyped
Every time I see a mention of the Athens FSharp group I get my hopes up then I realize it is Athens Greece not Athens Georgia
@EuroClojure Any timeline on when a city for the 2015 conference will be announced
@gigasquid A far off hope that one day you will have readable error messages is a litmus test to identify Clojure developers
Just submitted my first ever talk proposal @devnexus
The example in the first 8 minutes of this talk are all the motivation I need to try @TypedClojure 
Anyone interested in starting a @paperswelove group in Atlanta
Thurs a 60 year old told me about a trip her spouse was taking when she could have said husband I was impressed by the subtle inclusiveness
@samaaron Wow Congratulations

@gigasquid Thats awesome  I know what my niece is getting for Christmas
@bodil I got to the part about Ruby being the ideal replacement and decided it must be satire
@headinthebox For the last derby I kept asking is it over yet I am ok with fighting hard and losing 10
I wonder if I can get the rest of my team to try out testcheck  
@BartoszMilewski @bodil Great preface When can I buy the book
If it werent for the threats against @femfreq I might never have watched any of her videos  Powerful stuff
@ashedryden @ra We have an opening at 
@fogus Have you ever lived with cats  They already rule
Om has reference cursors and I like them  
@plexus Thanks for getting back to me Great template It is awesome to have such an easy way to set up a browser repl
@plexus I am having fun playing with Chestnut but I am surprised it does not include coreasync
@swannodette And in an instant my plans for the weekend have changed
@kelseyinnis I read yesterday that yall is preferable to guys Funny I made that switch soon after moving to Georgia from New York

@gigasquid I am so glad Clojure doesnt have tuples
Sometime in the last year my mindset shifted from I want to learn how to do X to I want to do X Now I am learning like never before
style suggestion for Clojure bloggers dont refer all from multiple namespaces in samples Its helpful to see which fns are in which libs
@cemerick Congratulations
