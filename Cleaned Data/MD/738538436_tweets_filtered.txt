Interjection is telling to me thoI didnt insult Carson there (elsewhere on merits yes)Yet you mitigate for RM 
gurghi Again your rhetoric was 11yearold playground stuff  I found a liberal who did it too  Weak logical fallacy of that obvious
gurghi Wwwhhhaaat You look completely past overt insult to Obama to worry the implied cost of RN association to Carson Twisted in a knot
Hold yourself to account rhetorically  If sure then why did you reply by citing random academic  You went there 
Billy did it too is the insight of 11 year old on playground RM not a random academic media mogul of our era 
Youre not ready to know Jack 
gurghi DavidPoland 1) No Harvard prof said it  2) Whoever did is as ass ignorant as Murdoch  Leaving you ZERO actual defense of Murdoch
  Already miss ya Joe  As warm a man as Ive ever met  And New Orleans to the bone

Mohjo09 MuffMacGuff Thank you sir
MuffMacGuff Of course  My head capable of holding two disparate truths at once  You
MuffMacGuff And with that you earn the affectionate sobriquet of luftmenschen
MuffMacGuff 19sevn7 Ghettoside by Levy  If you want to see the racial contempt of America where it truly affects communities
19sevn7 MuffMacGuff Yes Read Levys Ghettoside on LA Poor overpoliced on drug shit underpoliced where it matters Some arrests matter
MuffMacGuff I think the drug war is a war on the poor is entirely helpful and relevant  your trying to balkanize that not so much
MuffMacGuff Targeted arrests in Boston of most violent offenders cut murder rate by 50 percent  Arent murdered people a societal ill
MuffMacGuff Okay but Baltimore coming on 300 murders most of the poor could sure use some good policing now  Clearance rate 30
MuffMacGuff Yes  So its dishonest to imply that my saying police violence extends to poor whites is any effort to avoid talking race
MuffMacGuff Fuck ideology and your madeup slogans  Im addressing the breadth of the drug war   Address what I said not bullshit
MuffMacGuff Maybe you never saw cops work Pigtown or Morrell Park I have Racism elemental but havenots are all vulnerable to drug war
Never denied fundamental racial component  Have spoken to it repeatedly  But poor whites are targeted by drug war 
MuffMacGuff Reply to claim by attendee at NYerfest that I continually raised issue of whites being victims  I spoke in careful context
Look at classist nature of police violence The data show racial breadth of dynamic Ideologues+140 characters = BS 
Two thirds of those killed by police are white  People of color suffer disproportionately not exclusively 
This is dishonest AoDespair raised point 1x specifically about policing in POOR white hoods being brutal It is

BWGREENLEAF To look at sum of my stuff and think I accept a system that discards people well its the lefts usua circular firing squad
BWGREENLEAF Understood yet I think Im speaking to the structuralsystemic  Ignoringdownplaying it wont do shit  Call it what it is
BWGREENLEAF to think for a sec my critique of capitalism wo social compact is a justification for discarding people  Im a socialist
BWGREENLEAF Understand but I can only address my own purposes and narratives  But Im not fishing for compliments just dont want you
BWGREENLEAF EdwardEricsonJr If based on my work you bought into notion that I think people should be marginalized you missed it  Sorry
BWGREENLEAF EdwardEricsonJr I didnt buy into it  It is exactly how market capitalism works labor as a cost  Do I think it moral
BWGREENLEAF EdwardEricsonJr Maybe we disagree on my purposes in journo and drama Showing what IS has power what OUGHT TO BE nope
BWGREENLEAF EdwardEricsonJr That is not a critique of the poor  That is a critique of unrestrained capitalismlack of social compact
BWGREENLEAF EdwardEricsonJr I know I shouldnt interpose but dude Im describing an economic reality that I am CONDEMNING unequivocally

DeborahMargraff HBO Ms Keener is playing someone the same age as herself  The hair and makeup is to match the actual Mary Dorman in 1987
mindykaling Kiddo you are dead center of my demographic  You fool no one
informerny Are you using some sort of ideology bot that strings stuff together randomly  Argumentum non sequitur  Honestly cant folo
AnalogSyndicate No worries  Im out though  Thought it was just a neocon or libertarian foamer but nope it was something uglier
informerny Neocon  You sound um silly  The usual argument is whether Im straight socialist or alltheway Marxist  Neocon is funny
Animal1984Farm AnalogSyndicate theMRC Ah the internet  Didnt realize you ripe for a Chappelle routine  Im out on the reveal  Later
Animal1984Farm theMRC Laziest rhetorical fallacy in the book  Argue on the merits and omit the juvenilia
Animal1984Farm theMRC But back to my original point are you not embarrassed to be caught delivering argumentum ad hominem
Animal1984Farm theMRC They had a tax base to be sure  Read Hackers Two Nations before tweeting more nonsense about white flight plz
Animal1984Farm theMRC Proof in outcome  Scattered site housing in Yonkers didnt raise crime lower prop values  Despite white fears

Thx no I lack restraint Q1 to GOP Save for Mr Kasich youre all swine Explain statistical improbability 
informerny Fascism was fascism  And selfish isolationism was the greater amoral risk  And libertarianism never rises to such leadership
informerny Nor the few million Jews still standing in 45  They go to gas cause your kind spends 40  brooding on ideologyconspiracies
Julie32BJ That was hilarious  Also ASs 12 Angry Men sketch  But MDorman and CK a year apart only Makeuphair to match Dorman look
informerny Do you know what else libertarians would never do  Lend lease
LuxAlptraum No worries
LuxAlptraum Agree on your premise  In this case though hair and makeup work was to make Ms Keener more resemble the actual Ms Dorman
Julie32BJ Hardly absurd  Though she looks great in every regard Ms Keener is actually the same age as the real Mary Dorman in 1987
Julie32BJ The cast is actually ageappropriate and accurate to Mary Dorman in 1987  Ms  Keener looks great to be sure though
LuxAlptraum Although she looks younger to be sure Ms Keener is actually the same age as the actual Mary Dorman who she portrays
I could not love this man more
