Interjection is telling to me, tho.I didn't insult Carson there (elsewhere, on merits, yes).Yet you mitigate for RM. https://t.co/VKbUTAizo1
@gurghi Again, your rhetoric was 11-year-old playground stuff.  I found a liberal who did it too!  Weak logical fallacy of that obvious.
@gurghi Wwwhhhaaat? You look completely past overt insult to Obama to worry the implied cost of RN association to Carson? Twisted in a knot.
Hold yourself to account rhetorically.  If "sure" then why did you reply by citing random academic?  You went there. https://t.co/yGNQzYjWOT
"Billy did it too" is the insight of 11 year old on playground. RM not a random academic; media mogul of our era. https://t.co/lrK52VS58v

@WarZoneCameron For this stuff, Twiitter useless as fuck-all. Seriously. The half-assed circular firing squad of the left, always in play.
@Mohjo09 @MuffMacGuff Thank you, sir.
@MuffMacGuff Of course.  My head capable of holding two disparate truths at once.  You?
@MuffMacGuff And with that you earn the affectionate sobriquet of "luftmenschen."
@MuffMacGuff @19sevn7 "Ghettoside" by Levy.  If you want to see the racial contempt of America where it truly affects communities.
@19sevn7 @MuffMacGuff Yes! Read Levy's Ghettoside on L.A. Poor overpoliced on drug shit, underpoliced where it matters. Some arrests matter.
@MuffMacGuff I think "the drug war is a war on the poor" is entirely helpful and relevant.  your trying to balkanize that, not so much.
@MuffMacGuff Targeted arrests in Boston of most violent offenders cut murder rate by 50 percent.  Aren't murdered people a societal ill?
@MuffMacGuff Okay, but Baltimore, coming on 300 murders, most of the poor, could sure use some good policing now.  Clearance rate 30%
@MuffMacGuff Yes!  So it's dishonest to imply that my saying police violence extends to poor whites is any effort to avoid talking race.
@MuffMacGuff Fuck ideology and your made-up slogans.  I'm addressing the breadth of the drug war.   Address what I said, not bullshit.
@MuffMacGuff Maybe you never saw cops work Pigtown or Morrell Park. I have. Racism elemental, but have-nots are all vulnerable to drug war.
Never denied fundamental racial component.  Have spoken to it repeatedly.  But poor whites are targeted by drug war. https://t.co/5f4LNhbzZR
@MuffMacGuff Reply to claim by attendee at #NYerfest that I "continually" raised issue of whites being victims.  I spoke in careful context.
Look at classist nature of police violence. The data show racial breadth of dynamic. Ideologues+140 characters = BS https://t.co/ZI6mKNzBVy
Two thirds of those killed by police are white.  People of color suffer disproportionately, not exclusively. https://t.co/ZI6mKNzBVy
This is dishonest. @AoDespair raised point 1x, specifically, about policing in POOR white hoods being brutal. It is. https://t.co/ZI6mKNzBVy
@TheRealAshworth Sergei!  What up, G?
@jonnatonyeah Not after panel on race titled "The Fire This Time."  Not for the white boy.  He rightly does so with vague nausea. #nyerfest
@LauraMLippman It came up once, largely because understanding of what kind of policing happens in Morrell Park or Pigtown.  Continually, no.
Thanks to @jelani9 for putting us through some measured paces.  Big topic.  Lots to say.  But the panel was really well moderated. #nyerfest
@LauraMLippman Is this the day I need to write "I will check my privilege" fifty times on a blackboard?  Not today.  But someday, and soon.
@MrJoshCharles The root of the word is twit, is it not? From the Greek for, um, twit.
As the lone white guy, I either did okay or was the subject of some gentle charity. Seriously, panel was real fine.  https://t.co/GclMaHRtO7

@DMJreports We don't.  And yes, she is deeply appreciated.  Great actor, great heart and soul.
@BWGREENLEAF To look at sum of my stuff and think I accept a system that discards people, well, it's the left's usua circular firing squad.
@BWGREENLEAF Understood, yet I think I'm speaking to the structural/systemic.  Ignoring/downplaying it won't do shit.  Call it what it is.
@BWGREENLEAF ...to think for a sec my critique of capitalism w/o social compact is a justification for discarding people.  I'm a socialist.
@BWGREENLEAF Understand, but I can only address my own purposes and narratives.  But I'm not fishing for compliments, just don't want you...
@BWGREENLEAF @EdwardEricsonJr If based on my work, you bought into notion that I think people should be marginalized, you missed it.  Sorry.
@BWGREENLEAF @EdwardEricsonJr I didn't buy into it.  It is exactly how market capitalism works; labor as a cost.  Do I think it moral?
@BWGREENLEAF @EdwardEricsonJr Maybe we disagree on my purposes in journo and drama. Showing what IS has power; what OUGHT TO BE, nope.
@BWGREENLEAF @EdwardEricsonJr That is not a critique of the poor.  That is a critique of unrestrained capitalism/lack of social compact.
@BWGREENLEAF @EdwardEricsonJr I know I shouldn't interpose, but dude, I'm describing an economic reality that I am CONDEMNING unequivocally.
@robnashville Agree.  They were grand.
@robnashville Was a lot of fun.  Wish I knew anything about soccer.
@DeborahMargraff @HBO Ms. Keener is playing someone the same age as herself.  The hair and makeup is to match the actual Mary Dorman in 1987
@mindykaling Kiddo, you are dead center of my demographic.  You fool no one.
@informerny Are you using some sort of ideology bot that strings stuff together randomly?  Argumentum non sequitur.  Honestly can't folo.
@AnalogSyndicate No worries.  I'm out though.  Thought it was just a neocon or libertarian foamer, but nope, it was something uglier.
@informerny Neocon?  You sound, um, silly.  The usual argument is whether I'm straight socialist or all-the-way Marxist.  Neocon is funny.
@Animal1984Farm @AnalogSyndicate @theMRC Ah, the internet.  Didn't realize you ripe for a Chappelle routine.  I'm out on the reveal.  Later.
@Animal1984Farm @theMRC Laziest rhetorical fallacy in the book.  Argue on the merits and omit the juvenilia.
@Animal1984Farm @theMRC But back to my original point, are you not embarrassed to be caught delivering argumentum ad hominem?
@Animal1984Farm @theMRC They had a tax base, to be sure.  Read Hacker's "Two Nations" before tweeting more nonsense about white flight, plz.
@Animal1984Farm @theMRC Proof in outcome:  Scattered site housing in Yonkers didn't raise crime, lower prop values.  Despite white fears.

@informerny Fascism was fascism.  And selfish isolationism was the greater, amoral risk.  And libertarianism never rises to such leadership.
@informerny Nor the few million Jews still standing in '45.  They go to gas cause your kind spends '40  brooding on ideology/conspiracies.
@Julie32BJ That was hilarious.  Also AS's 12 Angry Men sketch.  But M.Dorman and CK a year apart only. Makeup/hair to match Dorman look.
@informerny Do you know what else libertarians would never do?  Lend lease.
@LuxAlptraum No worries.
@LuxAlptraum Agree on your premise.  In this case, though, hair and makeup work was to make Ms. Keener more resemble the actual Ms. Dorman.
@Julie32BJ Hardly absurd.  Though she looks great in every regard, Ms. Keener is actually the same age as the real Mary Dorman in 1987.
@Julie32BJ The cast is actually age-appropriate and accurate to Mary Dorman in 1987.  Ms,  Keener looks great to be sure, though.
@LuxAlptraum Although she looks younger to be sure, Ms. Keener is actually the same age as the actual Mary Dorman who she portrays.
