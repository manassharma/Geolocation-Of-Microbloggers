lemonverbena hed be in my top 15 though does that count drolland
drolland imo hes below everyone in lynotts top 6 + callie hawkes brown dickens jim beaver but above mcraney lemonverbena
lemonverbena oh wow i didnt realize you went that deep  what about ralph richeson drolland
lemonverbena i think farnum is similar i might quibble about placement of eb above calamity
lemonverbena thats a good list it probably reflects my top 6 but maybe not the order mckinnon is so good prob my fav part of season 1
