ilyasu congrats
spakhm yeah i should have set mine up that way i cant imagine any reason i would want dates in my db to be some are pdt some are pst
i need to have more kids so i can justify getting a model x
queries and dates in rethinkdb are timezoneaware makes me a bit afraid 
about 10 of the housing in san francisco is purposefully being kept vacant because of rent control 
ericnakagawa but when the exceptions are steve jobs and elon musk it makes the general rule an awkward one
ilyasu prob goin over to andrewljohnsons place
i dont care im getting the 2yearold hyped for supermoon 
patrickc it seems conditional though  you had to do a business plan competition
andrewljohnson jamesjyu chat is lame messaging is engaging difference is async expectation + push notification
hmm this shirt now has too much peanut butter on it to wear it to work
i was excited for spheros bb8 but its disappointing the motor is too weak to work on carpet and the head often falls off
if all you want is an active ingredient it costs pennies if you also want fda approval it costs $2 million 
rbranson sheki you should get those teeth
hey rethinkdb  afaict the rethinkdbdash node client is nicer than the official one why not adopt it
hunterwalk jasonlk thatll work well with self driving cars the office can commute to you
rbranson what the heck are your twitter usernames
refaelos sorry man i dont have a good suggestion leads on engineers are super tight right now
this seems like an area mipsytipsy would have advice on 
grantland and speaking of lol twitter i did not realize this was so ancient when i responded
grantland that was a tasty dinner i loved the twopeopleunderatentthenboxmanchasingsnakemonster
it is basic but it also means reported valuation is more than the companys expected value which is confusing 
zackkanter so youre saying theres a chance d
this bareknuckle citybycity fighting reminds me of uber nowadays 
til what ubers 1 city is before reading this article i did not know there was a city of this name 
andrewljohnson i dont think so climate change could be a big disaster but i dont see it destroying humanity pandemic would be my 2
andrewljohnson yeah imo biggest danger is that we blow ourselves up first
exome is not enough i want the whole genome this is cool though 
andrewljohnson i believe in progress just not in a singularity 1000xing whats possible now yes infinityxing no
this is why there wont be a singularity some things exponentially improve the others hold you back from infinity 
sama stories from loopt and what you learned
definitely reminds me of rubygems 
gordonbowman ilyasu i want it to be obvious when tapping something will cause a sound and when tapping something will not cause a sound
also twitter often plays the sound on videos that i didnt realize werent gifs fb tapforsound is way better 
i wish twitter would prevent people from deleting and reposting the same tweet repeatedly to boost its distribution
ccheever whats your preferred stack of technologies to develop things in es7
kellabyte ericnakagawa its just tough to ensure your services are resistant to singleregion failures and aws doesnt do it perfectly
rethinkdb typo in your docs for close on   connclose([noreplywait true ]callback) should s ]] 
i wrote a little hello world app with rethinkdb heres a screen shot of some of my beautiful code 
finally got around to installing rethinkdb it is not obvious to me from the docs how much i will like it guess i have to make something
tonsing yeah i feel like i should have learned this sooner why do they only teach the history of politics in history class
stevenstefanik im reading titan a fascinating bio of rockefeller hat tip to zackkanter for the book rec
zackkanter im reading this now and it is indeed awesome thanks for the tip
i didnt realize that cleveland was so central to the oil industry in the 1800s 
how about the ability to augment human brains to remember everything (funes the memorious great story) 
danprimack youre free to not show content to adblocking people just like restaurants are free to not serve food to people who dont pay
bussgang that title sounds extreme but the article is not very extreme my guess zealous editor
how i learned to use arrow keys also some math 
im pretty sure this was good screen time 
in 2001 the top 10 websites accounted for 31 percent of page views by 2010 the top 10 accounted for 75 percent 
jamesjyu ilyasu i wouldnt expect something like the web or something like app stores id expect some weirdo new thing
ilyasu 5 years
ilyasu is that really the choke point i would say the choke point is going from having none of someones attention to some
paywalls work for nyt economist but only the top sites what if all the mid tier publishers bundled together to share a paywall
ericries but how would their ads be targeted
could happen if the next dominant device only supports apps written in tcl 
shaunspringer in practice both are unlikely because a non monetized pageview is still a lot better than no pageview
if you hate adblockers dont serve content to people who are blocking ads 
seldo interesting id be curious to see this data for specific modules too can you get npm stats like  active developers using module x
ie npm usage doubling every year 
jamesjyu andrewljohnson or both (which is what i expect)
if publishers believe ad blockers are unethical they are free to refuse to show their content to people who are blocking ads
brandonmblack mipsytipsy once you ditch rails though theres nothing particularly great about ruby
lying sleepily in bed then 2 yr old runs in and yells what are you doing goodmorning
rbranson mipsytipsy id start by looking at what es6 will fix in the language then checking out express in lieu of rails
rbranson mipsytipsy and as far as metaprogramming goes the reactjsx tools are better than rails templating nowadays
rbranson mipsytipsy yeah this is why es6 is so key nowadays if youre using callbacks youre doing it wrong
davidlee mistercasey no company can generate profit forever look at 100 200 years ago
mipsytipsy i used to agree but javascript is much less terrible with es6
i agree it would be chaos to go straight to open borders but we could just raise quotas more every year 
lua you screwed this up and i can never forgive you 
ilyasu building a cool 3d demo quaternions are a great model for rotating 3d vectors
im actually using quaternions in my job today
mipsytipsy you know what they say build a product that you yourself have a compelling need for
cperciva thats a decacorn
really painful to watch the republican candidates answer which woman they would put on the $10 bill 
the japanese education minister ordered massive cuts to humanities and social sciences interesting 
ilyasu which do you recommend
by 2030 a third of american prisoners will be over 55 
in middle school i brought in a burglar alarm when you separated two wires it would beep glad i was encouraged rather than arrested
stammy dcurtis like a baby monitor that follows them around
ikirigin yeah i guess real problem is just opposition from those who perceive immigration as competition vc backing doesnt help there
stammy dcurtis killer use case is grandma talking with the 2yearold
ikirigin would you be cool with uber importing as many minimumwage drivers as they want )
ikirigin i agree but why privilege venturebacked companies over others
thought experiment could a program pass the turing test today if all sides were restricted to only communicate in emoji
delong noahpinion you cant derive gravity from the microfoundations because they havent reconciled quantum mechanics with gravity )
smasher5 ilyasu sriramk garrytan do any of you guys think this analysis is incorrect based on available data or just that it was rude
ilyasu sriramk garrytan eh if evernote had any simple growth data that disproved it they would respond they dont so they stay silent
garrytan well its not like theres a quiet period evernote is free to respond
perhaps the right term for evernote is a zombie unicorn  they keep operating but have no path to be worth gt $1b 
harsh analysis of evernote claiming they are essentially a dead unicorn 
issuing ssl certs will soon be free automated and open no how could is this can this be 
johnclyde lies worse is better
ilyasu hey i set up the dual boot on this machine not disputing your claim though
scottadamssays pm democracy does not incentivize that
ilyasu yeah us employed folks should just buy a new pc probably
ilyasu well steam is basically the only app store on this machine how does one even upgrade to win10 i just expect it to not work
ilyasu i checked on steam but win10 wasnt available

3 threebody problem  novel take on sf got some interesting chinese history in it too 
2 history of the container  the real world container not docker ) a big deal for the economy
