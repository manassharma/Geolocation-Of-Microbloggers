some of your [twitter] friends are already on storify click 42pagelisthtml fuck will all the interesting people please stand up
zpez theyd feel that way because you support folks theyd probably call terrorists too and the serpent goes on eating its tail gnite
zpez just as correct and think they were right in arguments on siprnet
zpez just as principled
zpez and theyd feel just as justified as you w panetta
zpez but somewhere someone in a soundproof room could be calling for your arrest for seeking to reduce americas intelligence abilities
zpez that is to say your affirmation of your principles is kind of cute i have no opinion on you personally
zpez i guess i see the reality of law differently youre principled and thats commendable also kind of cute but a necessary role
zpez back in 5 or 10 mins  phone call  hopefully thatll give you time to come up with something more than rhetoric
zpez please dont switch into contentfree general talk when youre in a tight spot w the specifics i doubt the audience appreciates it
zpez you cant really be this naive or as unaware of the intents and reasons behind difficult decisions as you represent yourself to be
zpez youre also off on the legal definition of treason in your posts do you ever read the laws you give so much lip service to
zpez you could be in the other side without having to change your mindset only switch around the names and enemies and you dont see it
zpez ive seen the inside of a number of courtrooms
zpez coining lamos law of natsec debates one party will inevitably call the other terrorists at this point discussion is closed
zpez you support whistleblowers who ignore legal avenues for disclosure ever hear of icwpa 
zpez youre either with the people or youre not lt= apropos of nothing you seemingly channeled george bush who you recently quoted
zpez it would create perception of conflict of interest because i put manning in military prison i thought that was clear  mdrasch
zpez to jump back a bit you advocate whistleblowers breaking laws but theyre laws that can be broken because youre the good guys
zpez i think that would create the appearance of an inappropriate conflict of interest   mdrasch
zpez im a fan of transparency just not radical transparency just a bunch of whistleblowers leaking whatever they want basically
zpez as nonstate actors we arent restricted by things like privacy act true but its all 100 legal ask mdrasch our general counsel
zpez as pvs acting pao (inter alia) i  can tell you we receive no tasking from the government
zpez the people involved could if theyd committed a crime affirm a public authority defense if they believed actions were authorized
zpez and i hate to break it to you but cops can break the speed limit without being ticketed legally
zpez cia is not bound by cfaa in the course of an authorized investigation if you read the statutes youd know this
zpez even a ci hypothetically speaking could get the signoff on engaging in an otherwise illegal act what counts is intent
zpez there are explicit exemptions in cfaa and other laws for authorized otherwise illegal activity your beef is with congress
zpez yeah i went down under cfaa in the microsoft conviction for visiting a web page i still plead guilty accountability matters
zpez to them being the good guy excuses excess to you throwing sabots into the system to stop them is fine because youre the good guy
zpez but more relevantly to my original post these people dont see themselves as attacking anything
zpez i had this talk the other day state actors can have otherwise illegal activity sanctioned by statute
mockewe just put a bullet in it already  gorillaglue
zpez just a reflection of the butwerethegoodguys mentality that fuels the people you attack the serpent eats its tail
