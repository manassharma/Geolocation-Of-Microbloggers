jimplush As for the False advertising Better to think of these instances as higher IOPS through SSD as opposed to SSD
jimplush They put all the new bells and whistles in VPC apparently
jimplush There is also the fact tat we are running in EC2 Classic Our TAMs tell us that VPC makes everything better
jimplush 2 you are right it is poor and can be better if properly tunedThat is why I put the disclaimer at the bottom
jimplush 1 You cannot compare SSD backed instances to hardware running SSD Xen obfuscates any OShardware advantages you get from SSD
Cache is usage not a technology
