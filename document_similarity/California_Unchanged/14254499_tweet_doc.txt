andrewljohnson yeah imo biggest danger is that we blow ourselves up first
Exome is not enough I want the whole genome This is cool though 
andrewljohnson I believe in progress just not in a singularity 1000xing whats possible now yes Infinityxing no
This is why there wont be a singularity Some things exponentially improve the others hold you back from infinity 
sama stories from Loopt and what you learned
Definitely Reminds me of rubygems 
gordonbowman ilyasu I want it to be obvious when tapping something will cause a sound and when tapping something will not cause a sound
Also Twitter often plays the sound on videos that I didnt realize werent gifs FB tapforsound is way better 
I wish Twitter would prevent people from deleting and reposting the same tweet repeatedly to boost its distribution

stevenstefanik Im reading Titan a fascinating bio of Rockefeller Hat tip to zackkanter for the book rec

ilyasu 5 years
ilyasu is that really the choke point I would say the choke point is going from having none of someones attention to some
Paywalls work for NYT Economist but only the top sites What if all the mid tier publishers bundled together to share a paywall

Could happen if the next dominant device only supports apps written in Tcl 
ShaunSpringer in practice both are unlikely because a non monetized pageview is still a lot better than no pageview
If you hate adblockers dont serve content to people who are blocking ads 
seldo interesting id be curious to see this data for specific modules too can you get npm stats like  active developers using module x
Ie npm usage doubling every year 
jamesjyu andrewljohnson or both (which is what I expect)
If publishers believe ad blockers are unethical they are free to refuse to show their content to people who are blocking ads

rbranson mipsytipsy id start by looking at what es6 will fix in the language then checking out express in lieu of rails
rbranson mipsytipsy and as far as metaprogramming goes the reactjsx tools are better than rails templating nowadays
rbranson mipsytipsy yeah this is why es6 is so key nowadays if youre using callbacks youre doing it wrong
davidlee mistercasey no company can generate profit forever Look at 100 200 years ago
mipsytipsy I used to agree but JavaScript is much less terrible with es6
I agree It would be chaos to go straight to open borders but we could just raise quotas more every year 
Lua you screwed this up and I can never forgive you 
ilyasu building a cool 3D demo quaternions are a great model for rotating 3D vectors
Im actually using quaternions in my job today

In middle school I brought in a burglar alarm When you separated two wires it would beep Glad I was encouraged rather than arrested
Stammy dcurtis like a baby monitor that follows them around
ikirigin yeah I guess real problem is just opposition from those who perceive immigration as competition VC backing doesnt help there
Stammy dcurtis killer use case is grandma talking with the 2yearold

smasher5 ilyasu sriramk garrytan do any of you guys think this analysis is incorrect based on available data Or just that it was rude
ilyasu sriramk garrytan eh if evernote had any simple growth data that disproved it they would respond they dont so they stay silent
garrytan well its not like theres a quiet period evernote is free to respond
Perhaps the right term for Evernote is a zombie unicorn  they keep operating but have no path to be worth gt $1B 
Harsh analysis of Evernote claiming they are essentially a dead unicorn 
issuing SSL certs will soon be free automated and open no how could is this can this be
