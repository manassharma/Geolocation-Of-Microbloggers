48705681	5469790672	“She wasn’t stripping,” said Jimmy. “Just cleaning up in the back. She’s too beat up to strip. But not so bad that she can’t pull a mop.”	2009-11-05 21:52:39				Richmond, VA
48705681	5469776891	Gus let out a sound that did not require words. "Is she okay?”	2009-11-05 21:52:02				Richmond, VA

48705681	5441377348	“Besides, Ritko travels alone,” said Jimmy. “The people we’re cat-mousing sent two cops to kill Jolene in a strip joint in Houston.”	2009-11-04 22:31:08				Richmond, VA
48705681	5441339941	“Been fired recently,” said Jimmy. “Maybe yesterday. These boys were up to no good and they ran into somebody who was up to worse. Me."	2009-11-04 22:29:26				Richmond, VA
48705681	5441325240	Jimmy examined the weapon fragment, part of the barrel. He pried it out with his knife and smelled it. He has sniffed a lot of ballistics.	2009-11-04 22:28:45				Richmond, VA
48705681	5441244971	“And if it was Ritko?” said Gus. As he finished his sentence, he saw part of an Uzi embedded into the tree trunk. "These guys were packing."	2009-11-04 22:24:57				Richmond, VA
48705681	5441209194	“Then we’ll burn it,’ said Jimmy. I’m surprised it didn’t go up on impact. Let’s light it up – after we get some pecans.”	2009-11-04 22:23:14				Richmond, VA
48705681	5441197623	“Pop, I don’t think we will find an inch of identifiable evidence over here,” said Gus. “They hit this tree doing at least 80.”	2009-11-04 22:22:40				Richmond, VA
