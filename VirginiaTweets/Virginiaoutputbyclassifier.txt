15348666	1032382566	@wbtech It's time consuming to digitize lots of photos - but a lot of retirees have the time, and enjoy it.	2008-12-01 09:18:38				Charlottesville, Virginia

15348666	1010060555	@dynamization Sorry such a slow reply, most people doing their own film/neg scanning use a Nikon Coolscan. Time intensive, but high quality.	2008-11-17 13:22:00				Charlottesville, Virginia
