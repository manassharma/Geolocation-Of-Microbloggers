14935864	4063026135	hey @M_Myers - good question. In my area (western Mass) the H1-N1 flu shot won't be available till mid-October earliest.	2009-09-17 15:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4063037275	@M_Myers today's flu shot was for everything else. :) (besides H1-N1)	2009-09-17 16:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4063677338	Really good talk with Rosenthal of Fonerbooks.com on how if you choose the right business focus and content SEO works itself out nicely.	2009-09-17 16:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4064294082	Fielding a question from an SAP FI sr. person on what they should learn next. I'm thinking GRC/EPM stuff (BO/BI top level apps). Agree?	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4064405301	RT @freakyfays: BPC is quite demanded, and all other EPM solutions would be a good complement for FI people. They can also look into FSCM.	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4064417673	Hey @freakyfays agreed on FSCM - good point! Also suggested they get some Xcelsius/dashboarding skills - u agree?	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4064587812	RT @nenshad: There is MASSIVE demand for qualified BPC consultants in market right now...but not many of available. Lots of pretenders	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4064712746	RT @freakyfays: Actually my opinion is people should stop being module experts, start being process experts, end to end, incl. reporting	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4064812470	RT @amolbharti: FI guys just need to understand dashboards -high level. need not to get into development stuff, what would we do then? lol	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4064937264	BTW @freakyfays I agree with you as you have probably noticed with all the "SAP process expert"/BPX stuff on my web site....:)	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4065120559	@InFullBloomUS I don't advise folks on solid ERP career path to switch packages BUT if I were advising a "newbie" I'd sure note SaaS options	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4065277279	RT @freakyfays Now people should start learning how to leverage these >>that's the BPX skills issue - establishing value w/companies	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
14935864	4065289597	@freakyfays in other words, we see a lot more jobs for "FI experts" than for "business process experts" or "Financial process experts"	2009-09-17 17:09:00				Springfield, Massachusetts
